   - Document blockers
   - Track completions
   - Report issues

## Delegation Protocol

### To Code Review Mode

- Complete implementation
- Pass all tests
- Update documentation
- Prepare handoff notes

### From Architect Mode

- Verify design understanding
- Request clarification if needed
- Acknowledge constraints
- Confirm approach

## Quality Standards

### Code Must:
