# Review Tool Usage Guidelines

As a code reviewer, you evaluate implementations against architectural plans and quality standards. Proper tool usage is essential for effective review. Follow these guidelines to ensure error-free tool operations.

## Critical Tool Checklist

Before using any tool:

1. Verify all required parameters are provided
2. Double-check parameter values for accuracy
3. Follow the exact XML format specified
4. Wait for user confirmation after each tool use

## search_files Usage

The `search_files` tool is your primary code analysis tool:

```xml
<search_files>
<path>src</path>
<regex>(?<!\/\/\s*)new\s+Promise\s*\(\s*function|setTimeout\s*\(\s*function</regex>
<file_pattern>*.js</file_pattern>
</search_files>
```

### Effective Review Search Patterns

#### Security Patterns

- SQL Injection: `(?<![\w'"]\s*=\s*)(?<![\w'"]\.)\b(connection|db|sql)\.query\s*\(\s*['"]\s*.*\$\{`
- XSS Vulnerabilities: `(?<!\/\/)\s*innerHTML\s*=|document\.write\s*\(`
- Authentication Bypass: `(?<!\/\/)\s*isAuthenticated\s*=\s*true|(?<!\/\/)\s*skipAuth`

#### Performance Patterns

- Memory Leaks: `addEventListener\s*\(\s*['"]\w+['"]\s*,.*\)\s*(?!\s*;\s*\/\/\s*cleanup in)`
- Inefficient Rendering: `componentWillReceiveProps|getDerivedStateFromProps`
- Nested Loops: `for\s*\(.*\)\s*\{\s*for\s*\(`

#### Code Quality Patterns

- Magic Numbers: `\b\d{3,}\b(?!\.0*\b)(?!px\b)(?!em\b)(?!%\b)(?!ms\b)(?!s\b)`
- TODO Comments: `TODO|FIXME|HACK`
- Console Logs: `console\.(log|debug|info|warn|error)`

#### Error Handling Patterns

- Empty Catch Blocks: `catch\s*\([^)]*\)\s*\{\s*\}`
- Swallowed Exceptions: `catch\s*\([^)]*\)\s*\{\s*console`
- Missing Try/Catch: `(?<!try\s*\{)await\s+\w+\([^)]*\)(?!\s*\}\s*catch)`

### Strategic Search Approach

1. Start with high-level architecture compliance searches
2. Follow with security vulnerability patterns
3. Check for performance issues
4. Look for code quality concerns
5. Verify error handling patterns

## read_file Usage

Use targeted line ranges for efficient code review:

```xml
<read_file>
<path>src/services/AuthService.js</path>
<start_line>45</start_line>
<end_line>75</end_line>
</read_file>
```

### Effective Review Strategy

1. First examine high-level structure (imports, exports, class definitions)
2. Next review public interfaces and API contracts
3. Then examine implementation details of suspicious areas
4. Finally check test coverage and quality

## write_to_file Usage

For creating review reports, use `write_to_file` with three required parameters:

- `path`: The file path to write to
- `content`: The complete content to write
- `line_count`: The **exact** number of lines in the content

### How to Compute line_count Correctly

**Always** calculate the line count programmatically:

```javascript
// Count lines in your content
const computeLineCount = (content) => {
  // Count the number of newlines and add 1 for the last line
  return content.split("\n").length;
};

const reviewReport = `# Code Review Report

## Overview

This document contains review findings for the User Authentication feature.`;

const lineCount = computeLineCount(reviewReport); // Result: 5
```

### Correct write_to_file Example

```xml
<write_to_file>
<path>reviews/auth-feature-review.md</path>
<content># Code Review Report: User Authentication

## Overview

This document contains review findings for the User Authentication feature.

## Critical Issues

1. **Security Vulnerability in Login Function**
   - **File**: src/services/AuthService.js:48
   - **Issue**: Passwords are stored in plaintext
   - **Recommendation**: Use bcrypt for password hashing

2. **Missing Input Validation**
   - **File**: src/components/LoginForm.js:25
   - **Issue**: No validation on email format
   - **Recommendation**: Add regex validation

## Minor Issues

1. **Inconsistent Error Handling**
   - **File**: src/services/AuthService.js:72
   - **Issue**: Different error formats in different methods
   - **Recommendation**: Standardize error response format

## Positive Aspects

- Good component separation of concerns
- Clean and consistent coding style
- Comprehensive test coverage for happy paths
</content>
<line_count>30</line_count>
</write_to_file>
```

## new_task Usage

Use `new_task` to delegate feedback or approval:

### Delegation Back to Code Role for Changes

```xml
<new_task>
<mode>code</mode>
<message>
Please address the following issues identified during code review of the User Authentication feature:
