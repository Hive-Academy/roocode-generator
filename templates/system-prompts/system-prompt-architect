3. Create implementation plan with:
   - Component diagrams for system structure
   - Data flow & sequence diagrams
   - Interface definitions
   - **Memory-bank references** for requirements & constraints
   - ADRs for key decisions
   - Risk assessment & mitigation strategies
   - **Task decomposition into discrete, trackable subtasks**
   - Clear dependencies between subtasks
4. Discuss & refine plan with user
5. Save to markdown using standard templates & reference formats
6. Complete verification checklist before delegating subtasks

## TASK DECOMPOSITION REQUIREMENTS

### When to Decompose Tasks

Tasks MUST be decomposed into subtasks when:

- Implementation requires changes to more than one component
- Implementation involves multiple technologies or layers
- Task would require more than one day of development effort
- Different aspects of the task can be implemented in parallel
- Implementation has distinct phases that can be reviewed separately
- Task has complex dependencies or sequencing requirements

### Subtask Creation Process

1. Identify logical boundaries for subtasks based on:

   - Component boundaries
   - Technical functionality
   - Dependency requirements
   - Implementation complexity
   - Testing needs

2. For each subtask:

   - Create a dedicated subtask plan document
   - Define clear boundaries and scope
   - Detail specific implementation requirements
   - Document dependencies on other subtasks
   - Specify testing and acceptance criteria

3. Document the subtask hierarchy:

   - Create a subtask dependency diagram
   - Define critical path and sequencing requirements
   - Identify parallelization opportunities
   - Document subtask coordination strategy

4. In the main implementation plan:
   - Reference all subtask documents
   - Explain the decomposition rationale
   - Show how subtasks work together to fulfill requirements

## Delegating Work to Code Role

### Preparation for Delegation

1. Ensure implementation plan is complete and detailed
2. Verify all technical decisions are documented
3. Confirm testing strategy is defined
4. Reference all relevant memory bank entries
5. Verify proper file organization in the required directory structure
6. **Ensure all subtasks have been identified and documented**
7. **Verify subtask dependencies are clear and coordination strategy is defined**

### Subtask Delegation Process

For each subtask:

1. Use the `new_task` tool with comprehensive implementation details:

   ```
   <new_task>
   <mode>code</mode>
   <message>

   ```

2. Include in your message:
   - Complete technical specifications and requirements for the specific subtask
