# Project Overview: [Project Name]

<!-- LLM: Use the overall ProjectContext (techStack, structure, dependencies, codeInsights map) to populate this overview. Note that specific project-level details like explicit goals or scope might not be directly available in the structured context and may require inference or general knowledge. -->

## 1. Introduction

<!-- LLM: Provide a brief (1-2 sentence) high-level summary of the project's purpose. Infer this from the overall context, such as main entry points in projectContext.structure.mainEntryPoints or key dependencies in projectContext.dependencies. -->

- **Purpose**: <!-- LLM: Describe the main goal, e.g., "To automatically generate code/documentation..." based on inference from the available ProjectContext. -->
- **Core Functionality**: <!-- LLM: Briefly list 1-3 key features inferred from projectContext.structure.componentStructure keys, prominent dependencies (projectContext.dependencies), or main entry points (projectContext.structure.mainEntryPoints). -->

## 2. Goals

<!-- LLM: List the primary objectives of this project. This information is likely NOT directly available in the structured ProjectContext. Describe general goals based on the inferred purpose and overall context. -->

- Goal 1: ...
- Goal 2: ...

## 3. Scope

<!-- LLM: Define the boundaries of the project. This information is likely NOT directly available in the structured ProjectContext. Define scope based on inferred purpose and observed structure/features from projectContext.structure and projectContext.dependencies. -->

### 3.1. In Scope

<!-- LLM: List functionalities/features inferred to be included based on projectContext.structure and projectContext.dependencies. -->

- ...
- ...

### 3.2. Out of Scope

<!-- LLM: List functionalities/features inferred to be excluded based on the observed context. -->

- ...
- ...

## 4. Target Users / Audience

<!-- LLM: Describe the intended users of this project/tool. Infer from the project's nature (e.g., developer tool, web application) based on the overall ProjectContext. -->

- ...

## 5. Key Features / Modules (High-Level)

<!-- LLM: Briefly list the main features or high-level modules. Use keys from projectContext.structure.componentStructure or infer from directory names in projectContext.structure.sourceDir and file analysis within the projectContext.codeInsights map. -->

- [Feature/Module 1 Name]: <!-- LLM: Brief description based on inference from ProjectContext. -->
- [Feature/Module 2 Name]: <!-- LLM: Brief description based on inference from ProjectContext. -->

## 6. Stakeholders / Contacts

<!-- LLM: List key individuals or teams involved or main contacts. This information is likely NOT available in the structured ProjectContext. Fill in if known from other sources or leave as placeholders. -->

- [Name/Team]: [Role]
- ...

## 7. Glossary (Optional)

<!-- LLM: Define any project-specific terms or acronyms identified during analysis (e.g., from projectContext.codeInsights map contents) or known conventions. -->

- **Term**: Definition
