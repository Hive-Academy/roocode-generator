## Custom Instructions: Workflow Integration

**Example from `.roo/rules-boomerang/01-workflow.md`:**

```markdown
# WORKFLOW INTEGRATION

## MANDATORY FIRST STEP - MEMORY BANK VERIFICATION AND ANALYSIS

Before proceeding with ANY task, you MUST verify AND analyze 
memory bank files with these exact steps:

1. Execute the following verification and report the results:
   - Confirm access to memory-bank/ProjectOverview.md
   - Confirm access to memory-bank/TechnicalArchitecture.md
   - Confirm access to memory-bank/DeveloperGuide.md

2. Report verification status explicitly:
   "Memory Bank Verification: [SUCCESS/FAILURE]
   - ProjectOverview.md: [FOUND/MISSING]
   - TechnicalArchitecture.md: [FOUND/MISSING]
   - DeveloperGuide.md: [FOUND/MISSING]"

3. If ALL files are verified, proceed with thorough reading and analysis
