# Implementation Plan: Generator Initial File Scan Fix

## Overview

Fix the generator so that on the initial run, it properly scans files and prints the scan message, eliminating the need to discard the first run.

## Subtasks

### 1. Analyze generator entry and scan logic

- **Status**: Completed
- **Objective**: Identify where the generator starts and how file scanning is triggered.
- **Files**: bin/roocode-generator.js, generators/config-workflow.js (and related)
- **Steps**: 1) Reviewed CLI entry and workflow generator logic. 2) Located file scan trigger in analyzeProject and analyzeProjectWithLLM.
- **Criteria**: Clear understanding of scan logic and entry point.
- **Notes**: The scan and analysis output only occur if the user accepts auto-detect; otherwise, the scan is skipped.

### 2. Trace/diagnose file scan and output

- **Status**: Completed
- **Objective**: Find why the scan is skipped or not reported on first run.
- **Files**: Same as above.
- **Steps**: 1) Traced state/conditionals around scan. 2) Confirmed scan and output are skipped if user rejects auto-detect or falls back to manual config.
- **Criteria**: Root cause identified.
- **Notes**: The scan message and results are not shown if the user does not accept the auto-detected config, matching the reported issue.

### 3. Implement fix for initial scan

- **Status**: Completed
- **Objective**: Ensure file scan always runs and is reported on first run.
- **Files**: As above.
- **Steps**: 1) Refactored logic so scan message and results are always shown, even if user edits or rejects initial config.
- **Criteria**: Scan runs and prints on first run.
- **Notes**: Updated logic in config-workflow.js to decouple scan from acceptance.

### 4. Add/adjust logging for scan reporting

- **Status**: Completed
- **Objective**: Make scan status/output clear to user.
- **Files**: As above.
- **Steps**: 1) Added clear console output for scan status, file count, and analysis results.
- **Criteria**: User sees scan message on every run.
- **Notes**: Logging now highlights scan completion and results.

### 5. Test generator for correct behavior

- **Status**: Completed
- **Objective**: Verify fix works and no regressions.
- **Files**: All affected.
- **Steps**: 1) Run generator multiple times. 2) Confirm scan and output. 3) Validate memory bank output is plain markdown.
- **Criteria**: No need to discard first run; scan always reported; memory bank files are correct.
- **Notes**: Manual test; confirmed fix.

### 6. Update memory-bank/DevelopmentStatus.md

- **Status**: Completed
- **Objective**: Document the issue, fix, and workflow change.
- **Files**: memory-bank/DevelopmentStatus.md
- **Steps**: 1) Add entry for issue and resolution. 2) Update status/milestones.
- **Criteria**: Memory bank reflects latest status.
- **Notes**: See below for update.
