# Completion Report: System Prompts Generator

## Task Summary

Implementation of the System Prompts Generator has been completed and approved following a code review. The generator is designed to create system prompts based on templates, adhering to established architectural patterns.

### Implementation Details

- **Completed**: 2025-04-20
- **Developer**: Code Mode
- **Reviewer**: Code Review Mode

## Implementation Summary

### Changes Made

The System Prompts Generator was implemented, extending `BaseGenerator` and implementing the `IGenerator` interface. The implementation correctly utilizes Dependency Injection for its dependencies and has been registered in `src/core/di/registrations.ts` and integrated with the `GeneratorOrchestrator`. The code quality meets project standards for readability, maintainability, and JSDoc documentation.

### Components Modified

See [[TechnicalArchitecture#Core-Components]] for component details.

- System Prompts Generator component
- `src/core/di/registrations.ts`
- `GeneratorOrchestrator` integration

### Technical Decisions

The implementation adhered to existing architectural patterns including extending `BaseGenerator`, using Dependency Injection, and utilizing the `Result` type for operation outcomes.

## Verification

### Requirements Check

The implementation fully complies with the defined architectural patterns and is properly implemented for generating system prompts based on templates, indicating that the core requirements have been met.

### Testing Completed

- **Unit Tests**: Not explicitly covered in review scope.
- **Integration Tests**: Not explicitly covered in review scope.
- **Coverage**: Not explicitly covered in review scope.

### Quality Checks

- **Code Review**: Completed and Approved (See [[reviews/system-prompts-generator-review.md]])
- **Standards**: Compliance with project standards confirmed.
- **Documentation**: JSDoc documentation is complete and accurate within the reviewed file.

## Follow-up

### Known Issues

None identified in the review summary.

### Future Improvements

- Consider the necessity of the explicit `validateDependencies` method.
- The hardcoded list of modes could be made dynamic in the future.
- Consider replacing type assertions `as ProjectConfig` with explicit checks.

### Dependencies Updated

None explicitly mentioned in the review summary.
