# Completion Report: Memory Bank Generator Implementation

## Task Overview

Implementation of the Memory Bank Generator component and its related services as part of the larger project refactoring effort. This task followed a refined implementation plan reviewed by the Architect mode.

## Task Status

Completed and verified through unit tests.

## Implementation Details

- Implemented core interfaces and types (`src/memory-bank/interfaces.ts`).
- Implemented `MemoryBankValidator` (`src/memory-bank/MemoryBankValidator.ts`).
- Implemented `MemoryBankFileManager` (`src/memory-bank/MemoryBankFileManager.ts`).
- Implemented `MemoryBankTemplateManager` (`src/memory-bank/MemoryBankTemplateManager.ts`).
- Implemented `ContentProcessor` (`src/memory-bank/ContentProcessor.ts`).
- Implemented `MemoryBankGenerator` (`src/memory-bank/MemoryBankGenerator.ts`).
- Created unit tests for `MemoryBankGenerator` (`tests/memory-bank/MemoryBankGenerator.test.ts`).

The implementation adheres to project coding standards, architectural principles, and utilizes the `Result` type for error handling.

## Verification Summary

- Unit tests for `MemoryBankGenerator` were created and passed.
- Code structure and implementation follow the refined plan in `docs/implementation-plans/memory-bank-refactor.md`.
- Integration points with existing services were considered during implementation.

## Documentation Updates

(Note: Specific documentation updates were not part of the Code mode's reported deliverables, but the refined plan included this. This should be a follow-up task if needed.)

## Next Steps

The Memory Bank Generator implementation is complete. The next task in the master refactoring plan can now be initiated.
