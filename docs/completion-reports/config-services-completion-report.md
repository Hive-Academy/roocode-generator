- **Developer**: Not specified in review
- **Reviewer**: Not specified in review

## Implementation Summary

### Changes Made

The primary change involved resolving a critical dependency injection registration issue for the LLMConfigService. The implementation ensures correct DI registration, maintains good architectural adherence, and upholds code quality standards. Consistent use of the `Result` type and Dependency Injection patterns was confirmed. The `validateConfig` methods were made public as intended, and the inquirer module is correctly registered and injected.

### Components Modified

See [[TechnicalArchitecture#Core-Components]] for component details.

- LLMConfigService
- ProjectConfigService

### Technical Decisions

The implementation utilized the `Result` type for handling operations and consistently applied Dependency Injection. The decision to make `validateConfig` methods public was implemented as intended.

## Verification

### Requirements Check

The implementation successfully addressed the critical DI registration issue and met the requirements for code quality and architectural adherence as verified by the code review.
