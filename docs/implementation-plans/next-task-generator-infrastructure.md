# Next Task: Complete Generator Infrastructure Implementation

## Current Status

The core infrastructure for the RooCode Generator refactoring project has been successfully implemented:

- TypeScript strict mode is enabled
- Result type is fully implemented
- Dependency Injection container is in place
- Core interfaces and base classes are defined

The base generator infrastructure has been partially implemented:

- `BaseGenerator` abstract class exists with core functionality
- `BaseService` abstract class provides dependency resolution
- Error handling system is in place

## Next Task: Complete Generator Infrastructure

The next task is to complete the generator infrastructure by implementing:

1. Template management system
2. File operations service
3. Concrete generator implementations
4. Integration with dependency injection system

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Template Management System

According to the technical specification in `docs/specs/template-management-system.md`, we need to implement:

- Template loading from files
- Template validation
- Template processing with variable substitution
- Template caching for performance

### 2. File Operations Service

We need to implement a file operations service that:

- Handles file reading and writing with proper error handling
- Creates directories as needed
- Validates file paths
- Provides consistent Result-based API

### 3. Concrete Generator Implementations

Based on the implementation plan in `docs/implementation-plans/generator-components-refactor.md`, we need to implement:

- Rules Generator
- System Prompts Generator
- Memory Bank Generator

### 4. Integration with DI System

Register all components in the dependency injection container:

- Template Manager
- File Operations
- Generator implementations

## Task Delegation Strategy

This task will be executed using multiple specialized modes:

### 1. Architect Mode

First, delegate to Architect mode to design the template management system:

- Design the template loading and processing system
- Define interfaces and class structures
- Create sequence diagrams for template processing flow
- Specify error handling strategies

### 2. Code Mode

Next, delegate to Code mode to implement the components:

- Implement TemplateManager class
- Implement FileOperations service
- Create concrete generator implementations
- Set up dependency registration

### 3. Code Review Mode

Finally, delegate to Code Review mode to verify the implementation:

- Review code for adherence to TypeScript strict mode
- Verify proper error handling with Result type
- Check for dependency injection best practices
- Ensure test coverage

## Execution Plan

### Step 1: Architect Mode Task

```
Create a detailed design for the template management system based on the specification in docs/specs/template-management-system.md. The design should include:

1. Class diagram showing the TemplateManager and related components
2. Sequence diagram for template loading, validation, and processing
3. Error handling strategy for template operations
4. Interface definitions with proper TypeScript typing

The design should follow the principles in ADR-0001 and use the Result type for error handling.
```

### Step 2: Code Mode Task

```
Implement the template management system based on the architect's design. The implementation should:

1. Create a TemplateManager class that implements ITemplateManager
2. Implement template loading from files
3. Add template validation logic
4. Create template processing with variable substitution
5. Implement caching for performance
6. Add comprehensive error handling using Result type
7. Include unit tests for all functionality
```

### Step 3: Code Mode Task (File Operations)

```
Implement the FileOperations service that provides file system access with proper error handling. The implementation should:

1. Create a FileOperations class that implements IFileOperations
2. Implement file reading and writing with Result type
3. Add directory creation and validation
4. Implement path validation and normalization
5. Add comprehensive error handling
6. Include unit tests for all functionality
```

### Step 4: Code Mode Task (Generators)

```
Implement the concrete generator classes based on the BaseGenerator abstract class. The implementation should:

1. Create RulesGenerator class
2. Implement SystemPromptsGenerator class
3. Create MemoryBankGenerator class
4. Add proper dependency injection
5. Implement generator-specific logic
6. Add comprehensive error handling
7. Include unit tests for all functionality
```

### Step 5: Code Review Mode Task

```
Review the implementation of the generator infrastructure components. The review should:

1. Verify adherence to TypeScript strict mode
2. Check proper use of Result type for error handling
3. Verify dependency injection best practices
4. Ensure comprehensive test coverage
5. Check for code quality and maintainability
6. Verify implementation matches the design
```

## Success Criteria

The generator infrastructure implementation will be considered complete when:

1. All components are implemented according to the specifications
2. All tests pass with good coverage
3. The code adheres to TypeScript strict mode
4. Proper error handling is in place with Result type
5. Components are properly registered in the DI container
6. Code review has verified the implementation quality

## Timeline

- Architect Mode Design: 1 day
- Template Manager Implementation: 1 day
- File Operations Implementation: 1 day
- Generator Implementations: 2 days
- Code Review and Fixes: 1 day

Total: 6 days (April 22-27, 2025)
