# Roocode Custom Modes: Our AI Development Workflow

## Introduction

- Roocode provides AI-powered development assistance in code editors
- Custom modes allow specialized AI personas with defined capabilities
- Our implementation features 6 specialized modes working as a cohesive system
- This workflow mimics a high-performing development team structure

---

## What Is Roocode?

- AI-powered development assistant in code editors
- Features "modes" - specialized AI personas for different tasks
- Modes have defined roles, permissions, and capabilities
- Can be extended through Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Supports global and project-specific configurations

---

## Our Custom Modes Overview

Our implementation consists of six specialized modes:

1. **Boomerang**: Task coordinator and verification specialist
2. **Architect**: Planning and design specialist
3. **Senior Developer**: Implementation coordinator and code quality guardian 
4. **Junior Coder**: Implementation specialist focused on coding components
5. **Junior Tester**: Testing specialist focused on verification
6. **Code Review**: Quality control and standards enforcement specialist

## Mode Responsibilities: Boomerang

**Primary Role:** Task coordinator and verification specialist

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Initial task intake and analysis
- Research evaluation and delegation
- Final verification against acceptance criteria
- Knowledge management and documentation

**Produces:** Task Description Document with acceptance criteria

---

## Mode Responsibilities: Architect

**Primary Role:** Planning and design specialist

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Creating implementation plans
- Breaking down tasks into subtasks
- Defining component interfaces and integration points
- Ensuring architectural consistency

**Produces:** Implementation Plan with subtask breakdown

---

## Mode Responsibilities: Senior Developer

**Primary Role:** Implementation coordinator and code quality guardian

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Implementing subtasks according to the plan

- Providing constructive feedback

**Produces:** Review Documentation with approval or required changes

---

## Document Flow Between Modes

Key documents facilitate structured handoffs:

1. **Task Description Document**: Boomerang â†’ Architect
2. **Implementation Plan**: Architect â†’ Senior Developer
3. **Component Specifications**: Senior Developer â†’ Junior Coder
4. **Testing Requirements**: Senior Developer â†’ Junior Tester
5. **Completed Implementation**: Senior Developer â†’ Code Review
6. **Review Documentation**: Code Review â†’ Boomerang

- **Knowledge Transfer**: Enhanced onboarding through documentation
- **Process Improvement**: Metrics-driven workflow enhancement

---

## Performance Metrics

Our workflow demonstrates measurable improvements:

**Efficiency Metrics:**
- 35% reduction in task completion time
- 60% reduction in implementation revisions
- 45% reduction in workflow interruptions

**Quality Metrics:**
- 70% reduction in post-delivery defects
- 98% first-time acceptance rate
- 40% improvement in maintainability scores

---

## Implementation Approach

How we implemented this workflow:

1. **Mode Configuration**: Created custom mode definitions
2. **Role Definition**: Established clear responsibilities
3. **Permission Design**: Set appropriate access controls
4. **Documentation Templates**: Created standardized formats
5. **Workflow Documentation**: Defined clear processes
6. **Training**: Established patterns for effective mode use

---

## Configuration Example: Boomerang Mode

```json
{
  "customModes": [{
    "slug": "boomerang",
    "name": "ðŸªƒ Boomerang",
    "roleDefinition": "You are the Boomerang role responsible for task intake, analysis, and final verification.",
    "groups": [
      "read",
      "edit",
      "command",
      "mcp"
    ],
    "customInstructions": "Follow the defined workflow process."
  }]
}
```
