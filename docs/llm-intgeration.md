# LLM Integration Plan

## Purpose & Vision

The goal of this integration is to empower the RooCode Generator CLI with intelligent, context-aware project analysis and configuration generation using Large Language Models (LLMs). The LLM agent will:

- Analyze the user's project structure and key files
- Infer tech stack, domains, tiers, and conventions
- Suggest or auto-generate rules, system prompts, and memory bank entries
- Provide a robust, user-friendly, and adaptive workflow for any tech stack

## User Experience & Workflow

1. **Auto-Detect Mode:**
   - On CLI start, user can select "Auto-detect project (LLM-powered)"
2. **Project Analysis:**
   - The agent scans the file system, reads key files (e.g., package.json, README.md), and summarizes the project
3. **Config Suggestion:**
   - The agent suggests projectConfig values (domains, tiers, libraries, tech stack, etc.)
4. **User Confirmation:**
   - User reviews and can edit the suggested config
5. **Generation:**
   - CLI generates all RooCode files as usual

## Technical Approach

- **File System Scanning:**
  - Use Node.js for basic file/folder listing and key file parsing
  - Use LLM/MCP agent for deep summarization and pattern extraction
- **LLM Agent:**
  - Integrate with LangChain or RooCode MCP for file system tools
  - Use langChain-llms.txt and langGraph-llm.txt (internal reference) to inform prompt design and capabilities
- **Prompt Design:**
  - Prompts should instruct the LLM to:
    - Summarize project purpose and structure
    - Infer domains, tiers, libraries, and tech stack
    - Suggest rules, patterns, and memory bank entries
    - Ask clarifying questions if needed
- **User Interaction:**
  - Always show a preview/summary before generating files
  - Allow user to edit or confirm the config

## Requirements & Must-Haves

- Must work cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux)
- Must not require user to have langChain-llms.txt or langGraph-llm.txt (internal only)
- Must support both interactive and config file-driven workflows
- Must be extensible for new tech stacks and project types
- Must enforce trunk-based development and semantic-release conventions
