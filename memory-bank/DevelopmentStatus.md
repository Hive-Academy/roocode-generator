# Development Status

## Current Status

### Project State

- **Phase**: Active Development
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Release**: Pre-release / v0.x

### Key Metrics

- **Code Coverage**: N/A (Testing framework not yet implemented)
- **Build Status**: Passing [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/<YOUR_ORG>/roocode-generator/<YOUR_CI_WORKFLOW.yml>?branch=main)](https://github.com/<YOUR_ORG>/roocode-generator/actions) <!-- Placeholder: Update link -->
- **Quality Gate**: Passing (Manual Review) <!-- Placeholder: Update once automated gates are in place -->

## Active Development

### Focus Areas

- **Core Generator Logic:** Implementing the primary functionality to parse configurations and generate files based on templates.
- **CLI Interface:** Building user-friendly commands and options using `inquirer` and `chalk`.
- **LLM Integration:** Abstracting interactions with different LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google GenAI) via LangChain.
- **Template Engine:** Developing the custom placeholder replacement mechanism.
- **Configuration Schema:** Defining the structure for input configuration files.

### In Progress

- Initial CLI command structure.
- LangChain setup for LLM abstraction.
- Basic file generation based on simple templates.
- Development environment setup (TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Husky).

### Blockers & Dependencies

- None currently identified.
- Requires API keys for respective LLM providers during development and use.

## Planning

### Next Milestones

- **v0.1.0 (Alpha):**
  - Basic configuration file generation for a sample tech stack.
  - Support for at least one LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI).
  - Functional template placeholder replacement.
  - Core CLI commands (`generate`, `init`).
- **v0.2.0:**
  - Support for multiple LLM providers (Anthropic, Google GenAI).
  - More complex template logic.
  - Initial unit tests for core components.

### Planned Features

- Extensible plugin system for custom generation logic or templates.
- Support for a wider range of template placeholders and conditional logic.
- Interactive mode for configuration generation.
- Validation of input configuration files.
- Integration with RooCode schema definitions (if applicable).

### Technical Debt

- **Lack of Automated Testing:** The project currently has `None` specified for testing. Implementing unit, integration, and potentially end-to-end tests is a high-priority item to ensure stability and facilitate refactoring. Tracked via [#issue-link-for-testing](https://github.com/<YOUR_ORG>/roocode-generator/issues/new). <!-- Placeholder: Update link -->
- **LLM Abstraction Refinement:** The initial LLM abstraction might need refactoring as more providers and features are added.
- Documentation coverage needs to be expanded alongside feature development.

## Quality Status

### Testing Overview

Currently, testing is manual. An automated testing strategy (likely using Jest or Vitest) is planned. See [[DeveloperGuide#Quality-and-Testing]] for eventual testing guidelines.

### Known Issues

- No automated tests are implemented.
- Error handling for LLM API failures needs robust implementation.
- Specific template edge cases may not be handled correctly yet.

### Recent Changes

- See `CHANGELOG.md` for a detailed history of changes per release.
- Recent commits focus on setting up the project structure, dependencies, basic CLI parsing, and initial LangChain integration.

## Release Planning

### Next Release

- **Target Date**: TBD (Aiming for Q4 2023 / Q1 2024 for v0.1.0 Alpha)
- **Key Features**:
  - Core generation command (`roocode-generator generate`).
  - Basic template processing.
  - Initial OpenAI integration.
  - Project initialization command (`roocode-generator init`).
- **Breaking Changes**: As this is pre-v1.0, expect potential breaking changes between minor versions (0.x -> 0.y). None specifically planned for v0.1.0 relative to the current `main` branch state, but the API is unstable.

### Future Roadmap

- **Q4 2023 / Q1 2024**: v0.1.0 Alpha Release - Core functionality, basic templates, one LLM.
- **Q1/Q2 2024**: v0.2.0 / v0.3.0 Beta Releases - Multi-LLM support, improved templating, initial testing suite, gather user feedback.
- **Mid/Late 2024**: v1.0.0 Stable Release - Stable API, comprehensive testing, documentation, potential plugin system MVP.
- **Post-v1.0**: Expand template library, add more integrations, refine LLM interactions based on feedback.
