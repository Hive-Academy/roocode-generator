# Development Status

## Current Status

### Project State

- **Phase**: Active Development
- **Status**: In Development (Pre-release)
- **Release**: Managed by Semantic Release (See Git Tags/GitHub Releases)

### Key Metrics

- **Code Coverage**: N/A (No automated tests implemented)
- **Build Status**: Passing (Based on local development workflow and CI checks if configured)
- **Quality Gate**: Not Assessed (Requires implementation of testing and quality gates)

## Active Development

### Focus Areas

- Refining LLM integrations via LangChain with providers like OpenAI, Google Genai, and Anthropic.
- Enhancing the interactive CLI experience using Inquirer.
- Expanding the capabilities of template-based file generation.
- Adding robust support for generating various configuration types: memory banks, rules, system prompts, VS Code Copilot configurations.
- Establishing core project structure and build processes (TypeScript compilation, dependency management).

### In Progress

- Developing core generation logic within feature modules (`generators` directory).
- Integrating LangChain for project analysis and automated configuration suggestions.
- Building and refining CLI command structure and user prompts.
- Setting up automated release pipeline using Semantic Release and Conventional Commits.
- Initial implementation of configuration file handling and template processing.

### Blockers & Dependencies

- None currently identified. Project relies heavily on external LLM APIs and LangChain features.

## Planning

### Next Milestones

- Initial functional alpha release (e.g., v0.1.0) demonstrating core generation capabilities.
- Implementation of a basic unit testing framework and initial test cases.
- Support for generating all initially described configuration file types.
- Stabilizing the core CLI interface and commands.

### Planned Features

- Comprehensive automated test suite (unit, integration).
- Enhanced LLM analysis capabilities (e.g., deeper code understanding).
- Support for additional LLM providers or model customization.
- Input validation and improved error handling.
- More sophisticated template options.
- Expanded user documentation and examples.

### Technical Debt

- **Primary:** Lack of an automated testing framework and test coverage. This needs to be addressed to ensure stability and enable confident refactoring.
- Documentation requires continuous updates as features evolve.
- Error handling is likely basic in early stages and will need refinement.

## Quality Status

### Testing Overview

Currently, **no automated tests are implemented**. Manual testing is performed during development. A placeholder test script exists in `package.json`, but a proper testing strategy (e.g., using Jest or Vitest) is planned.

See [[DeveloperGuide#Quality-and-Testing]] for testing guidelines (once established).

### Known Issues

- Absence of automated tests increases the risk of regressions.
- Error handling for edge cases or invalid user input may be incomplete.
- Performance characteristics with large projects or complex LLM interactions are untested.
- *(Refer to the project's official issue tracker, if available, for specific reported bugs.)*

### Recent Changes

- Refer to `CHANGELOG.md`. This file is automatically generated and maintained by Semantic Release based on Conventional Commits merged to the `main` branch.

## Release Planning

### Next Release

- **Target Date**: TBD (Aiming for an initial alpha/beta soon)
- **Key Features**:
    - Core CLI structure operational.
    - Generation of basic RooCode workflow configurations via templates.
    - Initial integration with at least one LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI) for suggestions.
    - Foundational support for interactive prompts.
- **Breaking Changes**: As the project is pre-1.0, APIs and CLI commands are subject to change between minor versions. No specific breaking changes are planned for the *immediate* next patch, but users should expect potential changes as development progresses towards a stable release.

### Future Roadmap

- **Short-term (Next 1-3 months):** Achieve stable core functionality for described features, implement foundational automated testing, release initial alpha/beta versions, refine LLM prompting strategies.
- **Mid-term (3-6 months):** Expand LLM integrations (more providers, advanced analysis), add more generator types/templates, significantly increase test coverage, improve robustness and error handling based on early feedback.
- **Long-term (6+ months):** Explore advanced features (e.g., generating code snippets, deeper project introspection), potentially add configuration validation, consider alternative interfaces (e.g., VS Code extension), and continuously refine based on user feedback and community contributions.
