# Project Overview: RooCode Generator

## 1. Introduction



- **Purpose**: A CLI tool designed to automate the generation of RooCode workflow configuration files tailored to any given tech stack.
- **Core Functionality**:
    - Analyzes project structure, tech stack, and code (via AST).
    - Interacts with Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate context-aware content.
    - Manages project and LLM configuration settings.
    - Generates specific configuration file types, including RooModes, VSCode Copilot Rules, System Prompts, and AI Magic content.

## 2. Goals



- Automate the creation of complex workflow and configuration files for software projects.
- Provide a flexible and extensible framework for generating configurations for diverse tech stacks.
- Leverage AI/LLMs to produce contextually relevant and high-quality generated content.
- Offer a user-friendly command-line interface for easy project analysis and generation.

## 3. Scope



### 3.1. In Scope



- Project analysis (file collection, tech stack detection, code structure analysis).
- Integration with various LLM providers for content generation.
- Generation of specific output file formats (e.g., `.roomodes`, VSCode settings, system prompts).
- Command-line interface for initiating analysis and generation tasks.
- Management and persistence of project and LLM configuration.
- Modular architecture allowing for the addition of new generators and analysis capabilities.

### 3.2. Out of Scope



- Execution or interpretation of the generated workflow/configuration files.
- Real-time code analysis or continuous monitoring.
- Full-fledged IDE integration (beyond generating configuration files used by IDE extensions).
- Comprehensive support for every possible programming language or framework (focus is on common ones with an extensible design).

## 4. Target Users / Audience



- Software developers and development teams.
- Users of RooCode workflows and related tools.
- Users leveraging AI-assisted coding tools (like VSCode Copilot) who need custom rules or context.
- Individuals seeking to automate the setup of project-specific configurations based on code analysis.

## 5. Key Features / Modules (High-Level)



- **CLI Interface**: Handles command parsing, user input, and output display (`src/core/cli`).
- **Project Analysis**: Core logic for collecting files, analyzing tech stack, and parsing code structure (`src/core/analysis`).
- **LLM Integration**: Manages communication with different LLM providers and handles prompt building and response parsing (`src/core/llm`).
- **Configuration Management**: Services for loading, validating, and saving project and LLM settings (`src/core/config`).
- **Generator Orchestration**: Coordinates the execution of different generation tasks (`src/core/application`).
- **Specific Generators**: Modules responsible for generating content for particular file types (e.g., `src/generators/roomodes-generator.ts`, `src/generators/vscode-copilot-rules-generator.ts`).
- **Memory Bank**: A module likely involved in managing project context or generated knowledge chunks for LLM interactions (`src/memory-bank`).
- **Dependency Injection (DI)**: Provides a structured way to manage service dependencies throughout the application (`src/core/di`).
