# roocode-generator

## Overview

A CLI tool to generate RooCode workflow configuration files for any tech stack. This tool aims to streamline the setup process for projects adopting the RooCode methodology by providing an interactive command-line experience, potentially enhanced with Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities for intelligent configuration suggestions.

## Project Essentials

- **Status**: Active Development
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Phase**: Initial Development
- **Start Date**: [Specify Start Date]

## Purpose and Goals

The primary purpose of the `roocode-generator` is to simplify and standardize the creation of RooCode workflow configuration files. Key goals include:

- **Accelerate Setup:** Reduce the manual effort required to configure RooCode for new or existing projects.
- **Ensure Consistency:** Promote standardized configurations across different teams and projects.
- **Improve Developer Experience:** Provide an intuitive CLI tool for easy interaction.
- **Flexibility:** Support configuration generation for a wide variety of technology stacks.
- **Innovation:** Leverage LLMs to potentially offer context-aware configuration generation and suggestions.

## Core Features

- Interactive CLI prompts for gathering project details.
- Generation of standardized RooCode configuration files (`roocode.json` or similar).
- Modular architecture allowing easy extension for different tech stacks or features.
- Integration points for various LLMs (Anthropic, Google GenAI, OpenAI via Langchain) to assist generation.
- Basic template engine for file structure generation based on configuration.

## Project Structure

### Technology Overview

See [[TechnicalArchitecture#Stack]] for detailed technical specifications.

- **Primary Stack**: Node.js, TypeScript, Langchain (`@langchain/anthropic`, `@langchain/core`, `@langchain/google-genai`, `@langchain/openai`), Inquirer.js, Chalk, Ora
- **Development Flow**: Trunk-based

## Project Status

Current state and next steps. See [[DevelopmentStatus]] for detailed progress.

### Active Development

- **Current Focus**: Building the core CLI framework, implementing the basic configuration prompts, integrating the first LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI), and defining the initial template structure.
- **Next Milestone**: Functional alpha version capable of generating a basic `roocode.json` file based on user input for a single, predefined tech stack.
