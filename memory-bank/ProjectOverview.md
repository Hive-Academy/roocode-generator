# Project Overview

## Overview

This project, "roocode-generator," is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to automate the generation of code based on user input and potentially leveraging large language models (LLMs). It aims to streamline the development process by providing a programmatic way to create code snippets, files, or even larger code structures. The tool is built using TypeScript and JavaScript, utilizing various libraries for interacting with LLMs (Langchain), handling user input (inquirer, commander), and providing visual feedback (ora, chalk).

## Goals

*   **Automate Code Generation:** Provide a robust and flexible mechanism for generating code based on predefined templates or dynamic input.
*   **Integrate with LLMs:** Enable the use of various LLMs (Anthropic, Google GenAI, OpenAI) to enhance code generation capabilities, potentially allowing for more intelligent and context-aware code creation.
*   **Improve Developer Productivity:** Reduce the manual effort required for repetitive coding tasks by providing a quick and easy way to generate boilerplate or complex code structures.
*   **Provide a User-Friendly CLI:** Offer an intuitive command-line interface for configuring and executing code generation tasks.
*   **Support Multiple Output Formats:** Allow generated code to be output in various formats or directly into project files.

## Scope

The scope of this project includes:

*   Development of the core CLI application for code generation.
*   Integration with various LLM providers through the Langchain library.
*   Implementation of mechanisms for defining and using code generation templates.
*   Handling user input and configuration through the command line.
*   Providing clear and informative output to the user.
*   Unit testing for core functionalities.

The scope does **not** include:

*   A graphical user interface (GUI).
*   Advanced code analysis or refactoring capabilities beyond generation.
*   Integration with every possible LLM or code generation engine.
*   Full-fledged IDE integration (though the generated code can be used within an IDE).

## Stakeholders

*   **Developers:** The primary users of the tool, who will leverage it to automate code generation.
*   **Project Maintainers:** Responsible for the development, maintenance, and evolution of the `roocode-generator` tool.
*   **LLM Providers:** Companies providing the large language models integrated into the tool.
*   **Open Source Community:** Potential contributors and users who can provide feedback and contribute to the project.

## Timeline

A detailed timeline is not available in the provided context. However, based on the project structure and dependencies, a typical development lifecycle for a CLI tool with LLM integration would involve:

*   **Phase 1: Core CLI Development:** Setting up the command-line interface, input handling, and basic output mechanisms.
*   **Phase 2: Template Engine Implementation:** Developing the functionality to define and use code generation templates.
*   **Phase 3: LLM Integration:** Integrating with various LLM providers using Langchain and implementing LLM-driven code generation logic.
*   **Phase 4: Testing and Refinement:** Comprehensive testing, bug fixing, and performance optimization.
*   **Phase 5: Documentation and Release:** Creating user documentation and releasing the tool.

Specific milestones and their dates would need to be defined during the project planning phase.
