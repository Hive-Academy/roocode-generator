# Technical Architecture

## Overview

`roocode-generator` implements a **Modular CLI application** architecture. This document outlines the key technical components and design decisions for this Node.js/TypeScript-based tool designed to generate RooCode workflow configuration files using Large Language Models (LLMs).

See [[ProjectOverview]] for high-level project information.

## System Design

### Architecture Diagram

_(To be added: A diagram illustrating the main components: CLI Interface, Generators, Templates, LangChain Integration, and External LLMs)_

### Core Components

The system is composed of the following core components:

1.  **CLI Interface (`bin/` & `inquirer`):** The entry point for the application. Uses `inquirer` to present interactive prompts to the user, gathering necessary information for configuration generation.
2.  **Generator Modules (`generators/`):** Contains the core logic for different generation tasks (e.g., creating memory banks, rules, system prompts). Each generator encapsulates a specific feature or configuration type.
3.  **LangChain Integration (`@langchain/*`):** Acts as an abstraction layer to interact with various external LLM providers (OpenAI, Google GenAI, Anthropic). Handles prompt formatting, API calls, and response processing for project analysis and suggestions.
4.  **Template Engine (`templates/`):** Uses template files (likely simple string interpolation or a dedicated library, though not explicitly specified) to structure the generated configuration files based on user input and LLM suggestions.
5.  **Configuration Management:** Handles reading potential existing configurations and writing the newly generated files to the filesystem.
6.  **Utility Modules (`chalk` etc.):** Supporting modules for tasks like colored console output.

## Technology Stack

### Primary Stack {#Stack}

- **Frontend**: Not Applicable (CLI Tool)
- **Backend**: Node.js (Runtime), TypeScript (Language)
- **Database**: Not Applicable / None

### Infrastructure

- **Cloud/Hosting**: NPM (for distribution), Local Execution
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions (inferred) utilizing Semantic Release for automated versioning and releases based on Conventional Commits.
- **Monitoring**: Not Specified

### Development Tools

- **Testing**: No automated tests currently implemented (manual testing, `npm test` placeholder exists).
- **Code Quality**: ESLint (Linting), Prettier (Code Formatting), `@commitlint/cli` (Commit Message Convention Enforcement).
- **Build Tools**: TypeScript Compiler (`tsc`), `copyfiles` (for copying non-TS assets like templates during build).

## Integration and Data Flow

### External Services

- **Large Language Models (LLMs):**
  - OpenAI API
  - Google GenAI API
  - Anthropic API
  - _(Accessed via LangChain)_

### Integration Points

- **User:** Command Line Interface (Standard Input/Output).
- **LLMs:** Via LangChain library, using API Keys managed by the user environment.
- **File System:** Reading templates, potentially reading existing project files for context, writing generated configuration files.

### Data Flow

A typical data flow sequence:

1.  **User Execution:** The user runs the CLI command (e.g., `roocode-generator create-rule`).
2.  **Prompting:** The CLI interface (`inquirer`) prompts the user for required parameters (e.g., rule name, description, target files).
3.  **LLM Interaction (Optional):** Based on the command and user input, the relevant generator module may use LangChain to:
    - Send project context (potentially analyzed from local files) and user requirements to an LLM.
    - Receive analysis or configuration suggestions from the LLM.
4.  **Processing:** The generator logic processes user input and any LLM responses.
5.  **Template Population:** The processed data is used to populate a corresponding template file from the `templates/` directory.
6.  **File Generation:** The populated template is written as a new configuration file to the user's specified location or the current directory.
7.  **Feedback:** The CLI provides feedback to the user (e.g., success message with file path, error messages via `chalk`).

## Key Technical Decisions

### Architecture Choices

- **Modular CLI:** Chosen for clear separation of concerns and extensibility. New generators or commands can be added relatively easily.
- **TypeScript:** Provides static typing, improving code maintainability, refactoring capabilities, and reducing runtime errors compared to plain JavaScript.
- **LangChain:** Selected as an abstraction layer to simplify integration with multiple LLM providers, making the tool flexible and future-proof regarding LLM choices.
- **Feature-based Generators:** Logic is organized by the _feature_ or _type_ of configuration being generated (`generators/`), promoting code cohesion.

### Design Patterns

- **Command Pattern:** The CLI structure likely follows this pattern, where different commands trigger specific actions/generators.
- **Template Method Pattern:** The generation process likely uses a template method where common steps (input, processing, template rendering, writing) are defined, with specific generators overriding certain steps.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Explicitly mentioned; the tool separates CLI interaction, core logic, LLM communication, and templating.
- **Facade Pattern:** LangChain acts as a facade, providing a simplified interface to the complexities of different LLM APIs.

### Security Considerations

- **API Key Management:** Users must securely manage their LLM API keys (e.g., via environment variables or secure configuration). The application itself should not store keys insecurely.
- **Input Validation:** While primarily a developer tool using interactive prompts, basic validation on inputs can prevent errors during generation.
- **Dependency Security:** Regularly audit dependencies (runtime and development) for known vulnerabilities.

## Development Guidelines

Detailed setup and practices in [[DeveloperGuide]].

### Standards

- **Coding Style:** Enforced by ESLint and Prettier. Configuration files for these tools define the specific rules.
- **Commit Messages:** Conventional Commits standard, enforced by `@commitlint/cli` and Husky hooks. This enables automated changelog generation and version bumping.

### Best Practices

- **Trunk-Based Development:** All development targets the `main` branch, with releases automated from it.
- **Automated Releases:** Semantic Release manages versioning, changelog generation, and NPM publishing based on commit messages.
- **Clear Separation:** Maintain the separation between CLI interaction, generation logic, and external service communication.
