# Technical Architecture

<!-- This is a fallback template generated automatically on 2025-04-27 -->

## Overview

This document describes the technical architecture of the `roocode-generator` project. The project is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to generate code based on user input and potentially leverage large language models (LLMs) for more sophisticated generation tasks. It is built using TypeScript and JavaScript, leveraging various libraries for CLI interaction, LLM integration, and utility functions. The architecture follows a modular design, separating concerns into distinct components for better maintainability and testability.

The core functionality revolves around processing user commands, interacting with external services (like LLMs), and generating output files. The system is designed to be extensible, allowing for the integration of different LLM providers and generation strategies.

## Components

The main components of the `roocode-generator` system include:

*   **CLI Interface:** Handles parsing command-line arguments and options using `commander`. It serves as the entry point for user interaction.
*   **Input Handler:** Responsible for gathering user input, potentially through interactive prompts using `inquirer`.
*   **Configuration Manager:** Manages application configuration, likely loading settings from environment variables (`dotenv`) or configuration files.
*   **LLM Integration Layer:** Abstracts the interaction with different LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google GenAI) using the `langchain` library. This layer handles API calls, prompt formatting, and response processing.
*   **Code Generator:** Contains the logic for generating code based on the processed input and potentially LLM responses. This component is responsible for structuring and formatting the generated code.
*   **Output Writer:** Handles writing the generated code to files or standard output.
*   **Utility Modules:** Contains helper functions for tasks like date formatting (`date-fns`), logging (`chalk`, `ora`), and file system operations (`fs-extra`).

## Data Flow

The typical data flow through the system is as follows:

1.  **Command Execution:** The user executes the `roocode-generator` command with specific arguments and options.
2.  **Argument Parsing:** The CLI Interface component parses the command-line arguments and options.
3.  **Input Gathering:** The Input Handler gathers any necessary additional input from the user, potentially through interactive prompts.
4.  **Configuration Loading:** The Configuration Manager loads relevant configuration settings.
5.  **LLM Interaction (Optional):** If the command requires LLM assistance, the LLM Integration Layer prepares the prompt based on user input and configuration, sends it to the chosen LLM provider, and receives the response.
6.  **Code Generation:** The Code Generator processes the user input, configuration, and potentially the LLM response to generate the desired code.
7.  **Output Writing:** The Output Writer writes the generated code to the specified output location (file or console).
8.  **Completion:** The process finishes, providing feedback to the user through the CLI.

## Technologies

The key technologies and frameworks used in the `roocode-generator` project are:

*   **Languages:** TypeScript, JavaScript
*   **Build Tools:** vite, tsc, rollup
*   **Testing Frameworks:** jest
*   **Linters:** eslint, prettier
*   **Package Manager:** npm
*   **CLI Framework:** commander
*   **Interactive Prompts:** inquirer
*   **Environment Variables:** dotenv
*   **LLM Integration:** langchain, @langchain/openai, @langchain/anthropic, @langchain/google-genai
*   **Logging/Styling:** chalk, ora
*   **Date Utilities:** date-fns
*   **Reflection:** reflect-metadata (likely used by langchain or other dependencies)
*   **File System Operations:** fs-extra

## Decisions

*   **TypeScript Adoption:** The project uses TypeScript for improved code maintainability, type safety, and developer productivity. This helps catch errors early in the development cycle.
*   **Modular Architecture:** The system is designed with distinct components to promote separation of concerns, making the codebase easier to understand, test, and extend.
*   **Langchain for LLM Abstraction:** Utilizing the `langchain` library provides a unified interface for interacting with various LLM providers. This decision allows for flexibility in choosing and switching between different models without significant code changes in the core generation logic.
*   **Commander for CLI Parsing:** `commander` is chosen for its robust and easy-to-use API for defining and parsing command-line arguments and options.
*   **Inquirer for Interactive Input:** `inquirer` is used to provide a user-friendly way to gather additional input when needed, enhancing the interactive experience of the CLI tool.
*   **Jest for Testing:** `jest` is selected as the testing framework due to its popularity, comprehensive features, and good support for TypeScript.
*   **ESLint and Prettier for Code Quality:** Implementing `eslint` and `prettier` ensures code consistency and adherence to best practices, improving code readability and reducing potential errors.
*   **Semantic Release for Automated Releases:** The use of `semantic-release` automates the release process based on commit messages, ensuring consistent versioning and changelog generation.
*   **Husky and Commitlint for Commit Standards:** `husky` and `commitlint` enforce conventional commit messages, which are crucial for automated release processes and maintaining a clear commit history.
