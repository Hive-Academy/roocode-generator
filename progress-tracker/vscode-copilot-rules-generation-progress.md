## Implementation Status

### Completed Items

1. Extended VSCodeCopilotRulesGenerator class with new functionality:

   - Added copyRuleFiles method for copying rule files
   - Added copyAndModifyMcpGuide method for MCP usage guide
   - Added updateSettingsJson method for settings updates
   - Modified executeGeneration to orchestrate the process

2. Implemented error handling:

   - Using Result pattern throughout
   - Proper handling of undefined values
   - Clear error messages with context
   - Fallback behavior for invalid settings

3. Added file operations:

   - Directory creation
   - File copying
   - Content modification
   - Settings merging

4. Maintained existing functionality:
   - Preserved Copilot language settings
   - Kept dependency injection pattern
   - Maintained logging throughout

### Verification Steps

1. ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
2. ✅ All required template files present:
   - templates/rules/architect-rules.md
   - templates/rules/code-rules.md
   - templates/rules/code-review-rules.md
   - templates/guide/vscode-mcp-usage-guide.md

## Testing Required

1. Run the generator to verify:
   - Rule files are copied correctly
   - MCP usage guide is modified and copied
   - settings.json is updated with correct references
   - Existing settings are preserved
