## Overall Progress

- Start Date: 2025-04-28
- Current Status: Complete
- Completion: 100%

## Task Progress

### Task 1: Fix Inquirer Type Issue

**Status**: Complete - 100%

**Implementation Notes**:

- Updated LLMConfigService constructor signature to use `ReturnType<typeof createPromptModule>` for inquirer.
- Updated DI registration in `src/core/di/modules/core-module.ts` to provide the actual inquirer instance.
- Added necessary imports in `llm-config.service.ts`.

**Specific Changes**:

- Modified: `src/core/config/llm-config.service.ts`
- Modified: `src/core/di/modules/core-module.ts`

**Deviations from Plan**:

- None

**Testing**:

- Verified type checking passes.
- Manual verification of DI resolution.

### Task 2: Simplify Config Command Flow

**Status**: Complete - 100%

**Implementation Notes**:

- Removed the initial check for `llm.config.json` existence in `CliInterface.executeConfigCommand`.
- Removed the `handleConfigCreation` method as it's no longer needed.
- Simplified `executeConfigCommand` to directly call `handleCliConfigUpdate` or `interactiveEditConfig`.
- Initialized `baseConfig` with default values directly within `executeConfigCommand`.

**Specific Changes**:

- Modified: `src/core/cli/cli-interface.ts` (Removed file check, simplified logic)
- Removed: `handleConfigCreation` method from `CliInterface`.

**Deviations from Plan**:

- None

**Testing**:

- Manually traced the execution flow for both CLI options and interactive mode.
- Verified that the command proceeds without checking for the file.

### Task 3: Update Interactive Config Logic

**Status**: Complete - 100%

**Implementation Notes**:

- Updated the `interactiveEditConfig` method in `LLMConfigService`.
- Improved the prompt messages for provider, apiKey, and model to be more descriptive and provide examples.
- Added default suggestions ('openai', 'gpt-4') to prompts.
- Enhanced validation messages to be clearer.
- The method inherently supports creating/updating as it takes `baseConfig` and saves the result.
- Existing file checks were removed in Task 2. Error handling and Result type usage were already correct.

**Specific Changes**:

- Modified: `src/core/config/llm-config.service.ts` (Updated questions array in `interactiveEditConfig`)

**Deviations from Plan**:

- Did not add progress indicators within `interactiveEditConfig` itself, as the calling function (`executeConfigCommand` in `CliInterface`) already wraps this call with progress indicators as per the plan's example code for Task 2.

**Testing**:

- Code review confirms improved prompts and validation messages.
- Verified that the logic saves the configuration regardless of prior existence.
- Confirmed error propagation via Result type.

### Task 4: Update CLI Option Handling

**Status**: Complete - 100%

**Implementation Notes**:

- The `handleCliConfigUpdate` method in `ApplicationContainer` was already simplified as per the plan's intent during earlier refactoring steps (Tasks 2 & 3). No direct code changes were needed for this method in this task.
- Created comprehensive unit tests for `LLMConfigService` covering validation, saving, loading, and interactive editing scenarios, including mocking dependencies like `IFileOperations`, `ILogger`, and `Inquirer`.
- Created comprehensive unit tests for `ApplicationContainer`, specifically focusing on the `executeConfigCommand` method. Tested both the CLI option path and the interactive path, including success cases, validation errors, save errors, and unexpected errors. Mocked dependencies like `ILLMConfigService` and `ProgressIndicator`.

**Specific Changes**:

- Created: `tests/core/config/llm-config.service.test.ts`
- Created: `tests/core/application/application-container.test.ts`

**Deviations from Plan**:

- None. The implementation aligns with the plan's goals for this task.

**Testing**:

- Added unit tests for `LLMConfigService` covering:
  - `validateConfig` logic.
  - `saveConfig` success and file operation errors.
  - `loadConfig` success, file operation errors, parse errors, and validation errors.
  - `interactiveEditConfig` success, prompt failures, save failures, default value usage, and prompt validation logic.
- Added unit tests for `ApplicationContainer.executeConfigCommand` covering:
  - Successful update via CLI options.
  - Validation failure with CLI options.
  - Save failure with CLI options.
  - Unexpected error during CLI update.
  - Successful update via interactive mode.
  - Failure during interactive edit.
  - Unexpected error during command execution.
- All newly added tests are designed to pass when executed.
