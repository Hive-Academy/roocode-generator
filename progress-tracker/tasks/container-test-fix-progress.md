## Task Progress

### Task 1: Add Injectable Decorator to TestService

**Status**: Complete - 100%

**Implementation Notes**:

- Added `@Injectable()` decorator import from `@core/di/decorators`.
- Applied the decorator to the `TestService` class definition within `tests/core/di/container.test.ts`.
- Verified that the core tests for successful singleton registration (`registerSingleton › should register...` and `registerSingleton › should return the same instance...`) now pass after this change.
- Noted that other test failures related to duplicate registration checks and error cause propagation persist, but are either unrelated to this specific change or expected to be fixed in the next task.

**Specific Changes**:

- Modified `tests/core/di/container.test.ts`:
  - Added import `import { Injectable } from '@core/di/decorators';`
  - Added `@Injectable()` decorator above `class TestService`.

**Deviations from Plan**:

- None.

**Testing**:

- Ran `npm test -- tests/core/di/container.test.ts`.
- Confirmed the specific tests related to successful singleton registration of `TestService` pass.
- Other failures observed are documented in Implementation Notes and are expected to be addressed later or investigated separately.

### Task 2: Fix Error Cause Propagation

**Status**: Not Started - 0%
