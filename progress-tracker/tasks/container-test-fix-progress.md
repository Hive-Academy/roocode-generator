## Task Progress

### Task 1: Update Test Setup

**Status**: Complete - 100%

**Implementation Notes**:

- Modified the `beforeEach` block in `tests/core/di/container.test.ts`.
- Used type assertion `(Container as any).instance = null;` to reset the private static singleton instance.
- Ensured a new container instance is created and initialized (`Container.getInstance()`, `container.initialize()`) before each test.
- Added `jest.clearAllMocks()` to prevent mock state interference between tests.
- Included comments explaining the reset logic.

**Specific Changes**:

- Modified `tests/core/di/container.test.ts` (lines 197-205 replaced with new block).

**Deviations from Plan**:

- None.

**Testing**:

- Manual verification confirms the code matches the implementation plan.
- Further testing (running `npm test`) will be performed after this task is reviewed and approved by the Architect. Test requirements include verifying no test interference and correct singleton behavior within tests.
