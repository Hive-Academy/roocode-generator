## Task Progress

### Task 1: Test Injectable Decorator Validation

**Status**: Complete - 100%

**Implementation Notes**:

- Added a new test case within a `describe('register', ...)` block in `tests/core/di/container.test.ts`.
- The test defines a class `NonInjectableService` without the `@Injectable()` decorator.
- It attempts to register this class using `container.register()`.
- Assertions verify that the registration returns an error (`isErr() === true`).
- Assertions check that the error is an instance of `ServiceRegistrationError`.
- Assertions verify the specific error message: `Failed to register service 'NonInjectableToken': Service class must be decorated with @Injectable()`.
- Added `ServiceRegistrationError` to the imports in `tests/core/di/container.test.ts`.

**Specific Changes**:

- Modified `tests/core/di/container.test.ts`:
  - Added import for `ServiceRegistrationError` from `@core/di/errors`.
  - Added new test case `it('should return error result when registering non-injectable class', ...)` (lines ~334-347).

**Deviations from Plan**:

- None.

**Testing**:

- Ran `npm test -- tests/core/di/container.test.ts`.
- Confirmed all 10 tests in the suite pass, including the new test case.
- Test command exited with code 1 due to global coverage thresholds not being met, which is expected at this stage.

### Task 2: Test Container Clear Method

**Status**: Complete - 100%

**Implementation Notes**:

- Added a new `describe('clear', ...)` block in `tests/core/di/container.test.ts`.
- The test registers both a factory (`ClearTestFactory`) and a singleton (`ClearTestSingleton`) using a simple `@Injectable() class ClearTestService`.
- It resolves both services initially to ensure they are registered and the singleton is instantiated.
- It calls `container.clear()`.
- Assertions verify that resolving the previously registered tokens now returns an error (`isErr() === true`) with the correct "Service not registered" message.
- Assertions check that the internal `services`, `singletons`, and `resolutionStack` maps are empty after `clear()` (accessed via `(container as any)` for testing purposes).

**Specific Changes**:

- Modified `tests/core/di/container.test.ts`:
  - Added new test suite `describe('clear', ...)` with the test case `it('should clear all registrations, singletons, and resolution state', ...)` (lines ~350-391).

**Deviations from Plan**:

- None.

**Testing**:

- Test case added to `tests/core/di/container.test.ts`.
- Will run tests to confirm this specific test passes.
