- **Developer**: [Developer Name - Not specified in review]
- **Reviewer**: [Reviewer Name - Not specified in review]

## Implementation Summary

### Changes Made

The implementation adheres to established architectural patterns including `BaseGenerator`, Dependency Injection, and the `Result` type for error handling. The core functionality for managing the `github.copilot.enable` key within `.vscode/settings.json` is correctly implemented. Dependency Injection registration for the generator is also correct. JSDoc documentation is considered adequate.

### Components Modified

See [[TechnicalArchitecture#Core-Components]] for component details.

- `src/core/generators/base-generator.ts` (Extended by the new generator)
- `src/core/di/registrations.ts` (DI registration added)
- New generator file (path not specified in review, assuming created under `generators/`)

### Technical Decisions

The implementation followed the project's established architectural patterns, including extending `BaseGenerator`, utilizing Dependency Injection, and using the `Result` type for error handling.

## Verification

### Requirements Check

The implementation was reviewed and approved, confirming it meets the requirements for generating VSCode Copilot rules.
