# Completion Report: CLI Interface Implementation

## Task Summary

Implementation of the CLI interface for the roocode-generator project has been completed and reviewed. The implementation introduces a dedicated class for CLI logic, uses `commander` for argument parsing, and integrates with the `ApplicationContainer` via Dependency Injection. The hardcoded version has been replaced with dynamic reading from `package.json`.

### Implementation Details

- **Completed**: 2025-04-20
- **Developer**: N/A (Implemented by previous mode)
- **Reviewer**: N/A (Review summary provided by user)

## Implementation Summary

### Changes Made

The implementation successfully addresses the major issues from the previous review. A dedicated `CliInterface` class is introduced for handling CLI logic. CLI commands and arguments are defined using `commander`. Parsed arguments are correctly passed to the `ApplicationContainer` via the new `runWithArgs` method. The hardcoded version has been replaced with dynamic reading from `package.json`. The DI setup correctly registers the new `CliInterface`.

### Components Modified

See [[TechnicalArchitecture#Core-Components]] for component details.

- `CliInterface` class introduced
- `ApplicationContainer` modified with `runWithArgs` method
- DI registrations updated

### Technical Decisions

- Introduction of a dedicated `CliInterface` class.
- Use of `commander` for CLI argument parsing.
- Integration with `ApplicationContainer` via Dependency Injection.
- Dynamic reading of version from `package.json`.

## Verification

### Requirements Check

The implementation successfully addresses the requirements outlined in the task, including handling CLI logic, argument parsing, integration with the application container, and dynamic versioning.

### Testing Completed

- **Unit Tests**: N/A (Not explicitly mentioned in review summary)
- **Integration Tests**: N/A (Not explicitly mentioned in review summary)
- **Coverage**: N/A (Not explicitly mentioned in review summary)

### Quality Checks

- **Code Review**: Completed and approved.
- **Standards**: Implementation aligns with architectural standards. Memory bank compliance could not be fully verified due to lack of specific CLI standards documentation.
- **Documentation**: Review report available at `reviews/cli-interface-review.md`. JSDoc comments suggested for future improvement.

## Follow-up

### Known Issues

None explicitly mentioned in the review summary.

### Future Improvements

- Add comprehensive JSDoc comments to the `CliInterface` class and its methods.
- Improve error handling in `CliInterface.getVersion` by logging the error.
- Add the `getParsedArgs` method signature to the `ICliInterface` interface.

### Dependencies Updated
