# ADR 0002: Multiple LLM Providers and DI Integration

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The project requires support for multiple large language model (LLM) providers to enable flexibility and extensibility in AI model usage. The existing architecture must be refactored to integrate these providers cleanly using dependency injection (DI) to avoid static imports and direct instantiations that reduce testability and flexibility.

Additionally, the implementation must strictly follow the task progress tracking and refactoring plan to ensure incremental, validated changes that maintain backward compatibility and align with project coding standards.

## Decision

- Define a common interface `ILLMProvider` that all LLM providers implement.
- Use a DI container to register multiple named or tagged bindings for different LLM providers.
- Implement a provider registry or factory pattern to resolve the appropriate provider at runtime based on configuration or context.
- Implement `LLMAgent` to consume injected `ILLMProvider` instances, supporting extensibility and robust error handling.
- Enforce all dependencies to be injected via DI; prohibit static imports or direct instantiations of providers or agents.
- Use the `Result` type consistently for error handling and propagation.
- Adhere strictly to the task progress tracking and refactoring plan, including incremental refactoring, feature flags, and comprehensive testing.
- Document progress continuously in `task-progress.md`.

## Consequences

- Enables flexible addition of new LLM providers without modifying existing code.
- Improves testability and maintainability through DI and interface segregation.
- Ensures consistent error handling and diagnostics.
- Requires discipline in following task progress tracking and refactoring protocols.
- May introduce complexity in DI container configuration and provider resolution logic.

## Alternatives Considered

- Static factory methods for provider selection: rejected due to reduced testability and flexibility.
- Single monolithic LLM provider implementation: rejected due to lack of extensibility and violation of Open/Closed Principle.
