# Task Progress: VSCode Copilot Rules ENOENT Fix

## References

- Implementation Plan: Fix for ENOENT error in VSCodeCopilotRulesGenerator
- Technical Specification: Ensure `.vscode/settings.json` exists before modification

## Implementation Status

- [x] Added explicit handling for ENOENT error case
- [x] Implemented file creation with empty JSON object
- [x] Added debug logging for file creation
- [x] Added error handling for file creation operation
- [x] Maintained existing error handling patterns
- [x] Verified integration with existing code flow

## Implementation Notes

The implementation follows the architectural guidance by:

1. Catching ENOENT error specifically when file doesn't exist
2. Creating file with valid JSON content (`{}`)
3. Maintaining proper error handling chain
4. Using appropriate logging for debugging
5. Following existing code patterns and style

## Testing Considerations

The implementation should be tested for:

- Case when settings.json doesn't exist
- Case when settings.json exists with valid content
- Case when file creation fails
- Case when directory permissions prevent file creation

## Progress: 100%

Implementation complete and ready for review.
