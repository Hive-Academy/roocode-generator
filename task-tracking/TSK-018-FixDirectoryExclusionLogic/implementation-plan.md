# Implementation Plan: TSK-018/FixDirectoryExclusionLogic

## Overview

This plan outlines the steps to fix the directory exclusion logic in the `generateDirectoryTree` function within `src/core/analysis/structure-helpers.ts`. The goal is to ensure that directories listed in `SKIP_DIRECTORIES` (from `src/core/analysis/constants.ts`) and hidden directories (names starting with a `.`) are correctly excluded from the `ProjectContext.structure.directoryTree`. This will lead to a more accurate and lean project representation, crucial for downstream processes.

See `task-tracking/TSK-018-FixDirectoryExclusionLogic/task-description.md` for detailed requirements.

## Implementation Strategy

### Approach

The core of the implementation involves modifying the `generateDirectoryTree` function in `src/core/analysis/structure-helpers.ts`. Before recursively processing a directory, we will add checks to see if its name matches any in the `SKIP_DIRECTORIES` set or if it's a hidden directory (starts with a `.`). If either condition is met, the directory will be skipped. Existing file-level filtering and empty directory pruning logic will be preserved.

### Key Components

- **Affected Areas**:
  - `src/core/analysis/structure-helpers.ts`: Primarily the `generateDirectoryTree` function.
  - Unit tests for `generateDirectoryTree`.
- **Dependencies**:
  - `src/core/analysis/constants.ts`: For the `SKIP_DIRECTORIES` constant.
- **Risk Areas**:
  - Ensuring the new exclusion logic doesn't interfere with existing file filtering or pruning.
  - Correctly handling edge cases in directory structures.

## Implementation Subtasks

### 1. Modify `generateDirectoryTree` for Exclusion Logic

**Status**: Completed

**Description**: Update the `generateDirectoryTree` function in `src/core/analysis/structure-helpers.ts` to implement the directory exclusion logic. This involves importing `SKIP_DIRECTORIES` and adding checks for excluded and hidden directories.

**Files to Modify**:

- `src/core/analysis/structure-helpers.ts`:
  - Import `SKIP_DIRECTORIES` from `../constants`.
  - In the `for (const item of items)` loop within `generateDirectoryTree`, before the `if (item.isDirectory())` block, add logic to check if `SKIP_DIRECTORIES.has(item.name)` or `item.name.startsWith('.')`. If true, `continue` to the next item.

**Implementation Details**:

```typescript
// In src/core/analysis/structure-helpers.ts
import { SKIP_DIRECTORIES } from '../constants'; // Add this import

// ... inside generateDirectoryTree function, within the for loop:
// for (const item of items) {
//   const itemPath = path.join(absoluteCurrentPath, item.name);
//   const relativePath = path.relative(rootDir, itemPath);

//   // ADD THE NEW EXCLUSION LOGIC HERE:
//   if (item.isDirectory()) { // Only apply these checks to directories
//     if (SKIP_DIRECTORIES.has(item.name) || item.name.startsWith('.')) {
//       continue; // Skip this directory
//     }
//   }
//   // Original logic continues below...
//   if (item.isDirectory()) { ... }
// }
```

**Testing Requirements**:

- Manual verification during development by running `ProjectAnalyzer` on the current project.
- Unit tests will be added in a subsequent subtask.

**Related Acceptance Criteria**:

- AC1: `SKIP_DIRECTORIES` Integration
- AC2: Hidden Directory Exclusion

**Estimated effort**: 15-30 minutes

**Required Delegation Components**:

- Implementation components for Junior Coder:
  - The core logic modification within `generateDirectoryTree` as described above.
- Testing components for Junior Tester:
  - N/A for this subtask (unit tests are in Subtask 2).

**Delegation Success Criteria**:

- Junior Coder component must:
  - Correctly import `SKIP_DIRECTORIES`.
  - Implement the exclusion checks accurately before the existing `item.isDirectory()` block that handles recursion.
  - Ensure the `continue` statement correctly skips the processing of the excluded directory.

**Delegation and Verification Summary**:

- Delegated to Junior Coder: Modification of `generateDirectoryTree` in `src/core/analysis/structure-helpers.ts`.
- Junior Coder successfully implemented the changes as per specifications.
- Acceptance Criteria Verification:
  - AC1: `SKIP_DIRECTORIES` Integration: Verified. `SKIP_DIRECTORIES` imported and used in the condition.
  - AC2: Hidden Directory Exclusion: Verified. `item.name.startsWith('.')` used in the condition.
  - Additional checks: Logic applies only to directories and is correctly placed before recursion. Verified.
- No redelegations were necessary.

### 2. Add Unit Tests for `generateDirectoryTree`

**Status**: Completed

**Description**: Create new unit tests for the `generateDirectoryTree` function. These tests should specifically cover the new exclusion logic, ensuring that `SKIP_DIRECTORIES` and hidden directories are handled correctly, while valid content is preserved and existing filtering/pruning logic remains functional.

**Files to Modify**:

- `tests/core/analysis/structure-helpers.test.ts` (Create this file if it doesn't exist, or add to an existing relevant test file).

**Implementation Details**:

- Mock `fs.Dirent` and `IFileOperations` (specifically `readDir` and `exists`/`isDirectory` if needed for complex mocks).
- Create test cases with various directory structures:
  - A directory listed in `SKIP_DIRECTORIES` (e.g., `node_modules`).
  - A hidden directory (e.g., `.git`).
  - A mix of excluded and included directories.
  - Nested excluded directories.
  - Directories that should be pruned because all their children are excluded or non-analyzable.
  - Directories with analyzable files that should be included.
- Assert that the output of `generateDirectoryTree` matches the expected structure.

```typescript
// Example test case structure in tests/core/analysis/structure-helpers.test.ts
// import { generateDirectoryTree } from 'src/core/analysis/structure-helpers';
// import { SKIP_DIRECTORIES } from 'src/core/analysis/constants';
// import { IFileOperations } from 'src/core/file-operations/interfaces';
// import { Dirent } from 'fs';
// import { Result, Ok, Err } from 'oxide.ts';

// const mockFileOps: IFileOperations = {
//   // ... mock methods like readDir, readFile, exists, isDirectory
//   readDir: jest.fn(),
//   // ...
// };

// const mockShouldAnalyzeFile = (filePath: string) => !filePath.endsWith('.ignore');

// describe('generateDirectoryTree', () => {
//   beforeEach(() => {
//     (mockFileOps.readDir as jest.Mock).mockReset();
//   });

//   it('should exclude directories listed in SKIP_DIRECTORIES', async () => {
//     (mockFileOps.readDir as jest.Mock)
//       .mockResolvedValueOnce(Ok([
//         { name: 'src', isDirectory: () => true, isFile: () => false } as Dirent,
//         { name: 'node_modules', isDirectory: () => true, isFile: () => false } as Dirent,
//       ])) // Root
//       .mockResolvedValueOnce(Ok([
//         { name: 'index.ts', isDirectory: () => false, isFile: () => true } as Dirent,
//       ])); // src

//     const tree = await generateDirectoryTree('/', '/', mockFileOps, mockShouldAnalyzeFile);
//     expect(tree.find(node => node.name === 'node_modules')).toBeUndefined();
//     expect(tree.find(node => node.name === 'src')).toBeDefined();
//   });

//   it('should exclude hidden directories', async () => {
//     // ... similar setup for .git or .vscode
//   });

//   // ... more test cases for AC6 and AC7
// });
```

**Testing Requirements**:

- All new unit tests must pass.
- Test coverage for the exclusion logic in `generateDirectoryTree` should be high.

**Related Acceptance Criteria**:

- AC1: `SKIP_DIRECTORIES` Integration (verified by tests)
- AC2: Hidden Directory Exclusion (verified by tests)
- AC5: Preservation of Valid Content (verified by tests)
- AC6: Unit Tests
- AC7: No Regressions (verified by tests covering existing logic)

**Estimated effort**: 30-45 minutes

**Required Delegation Components**:

- Implementation components for Junior Coder:
  - N/A (Senior Developer to ensure test structure is sound, Junior Tester to implement specific cases).
- Testing components for Junior Tester:
  - Implementation of all test cases outlined above, including:
    - Test for `SKIP_DIRECTORIES` exclusion.
    - Test for hidden directory exclusion.
    - Test for mixed included/excluded directories.
    - Test for nested exclusions.
    - Test for pruning logic in conjunction with new exclusions.
    - Test for preservation of valid content.
- Integration requirements:
  - Junior Tester will need the modified `generateDirectoryTree` function from Subtask 1.
  - Tests should be added to the project's test suite and run as part of the standard test execution.

**Delegation Success Criteria**:

- Junior Tester components must:
  - Cover all specified scenarios for exclusion and preservation.
  - Use appropriate mocking for `IFileOperations` and `Dirent`.
  - Ensure assertions accurately reflect the expected behavior of `generateDirectoryTree`.
  - Achieve good test coverage for the modified function.

**Delegation and Verification Summary**:

- Delegated to Junior Tester: Implementation of test cases for `generateDirectoryTree` in `tests/core/analysis/structure-helpers.test.ts`.
- Junior Tester successfully implemented the test cases covering all specified scenarios.
- Senior Developer reviewed the tests and performed several iterations of debugging, primarily related to TypeScript typings for mocks and path resolution consistency within the test environment. The core test logic provided by the Junior Tester was sound. No formal redelegation for test case logic was required.
- All 11 unit tests now pass.
- Acceptance Criteria Verification:
  - AC1 (`SKIP_DIRECTORIES` Integration): Verified by tests ensuring `node_modules` and other skipped dirs are excluded.
  - AC2 (Hidden Directory Exclusion): Verified by tests ensuring directories like `.git` are excluded.
  - AC5 (Preservation of Valid Content): Verified by tests ensuring valid files/directories are included and `shouldAnalyzeFile` logic is preserved.
  - AC6 (Unit Tests): Satisfied by the creation and successful execution of `structure-helpers.test.ts`.
  - AC7 (No Regressions): Verified by tests covering pruning logic and its interaction with new exclusions and `shouldAnalyzeFile`.

## Implementation Sequence

1.  **Modify `generateDirectoryTree` for Exclusion Logic**: Implement the core change first to enable testing.
2.  **Add Unit Tests for `generateDirectoryTree`**: Create comprehensive tests to verify the new logic and ensure no regressions.

## Acceptance Criteria Mapping

- **AC1 (SKIP_DIRECTORIES Integration):**
  - Satisfied by: Modifying `generateDirectoryTree` to import and use `SKIP_DIRECTORIES`.
  - Subtasks: 1 (implementation), 2 (unit test verification).
  - Verification: Code review of `structure-helpers.ts`, passing unit tests.
- **AC2 (Hidden Directory Exclusion):**
  - Satisfied by: Modifying `generateDirectoryTree` to check for directory names starting with `.`.
  - Subtasks: 1 (implementation), 2 (unit test verification).
  - Verification: Code review of `structure-helpers.ts`, passing unit tests.
- **AC3 (Correct Exclusion in ProjectContext - SKIP_DIRECTORIES):**
  - Satisfied by: The correct implementation in `generateDirectoryTree` ensuring `node_modules`, `dist`, etc., are not in the tree.
  - Subtasks: 1, 2.
  - Verification: Manual inspection of `ProjectContext.structure.directoryTree` after running `ProjectAnalyzer` on a test project or `roocode-generator` itself, post-implementation. (Unit tests provide strong evidence).
- **AC4 (Correct Exclusion in ProjectContext - Hidden Dirs):**
  - Satisfied by: The correct implementation in `generateDirectoryTree` ensuring hidden directories are not in the tree.
  - Subtasks: 1, 2.

  - Subtasks: 1 (careful implementation), 2 (unit tests covering these aspects).
  - Verification: Existing tests (if any) passing, new unit tests covering these interactions, manual inspection for complex cases.

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: New unit tests for `generateDirectoryTree` will be the primary method for verifying the correctness of the exclusion logic and ensuring no regressions. These tests will mock dependencies and cover various scenarios as detailed in Subtask 2.
- **Integration Testing (Manual/Semi-Automated)**: After the code changes and unit tests are in place, `ProjectAnalyzer.analyzeProject` will be run on the `roocode-generator` project (or a dedicated test project with a known structure including excludable directories). The resulting `ProjectContext.structure.directoryTree` will be inspected to manually verify AC3, AC4, and AC5. This can be done by logging the structure or using a debug script.

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture Impact

The change is localized to `structure-helpers.ts` and its unit tests. It enhances the accuracy of a core data structure (`directoryTree`) used by `ProjectAnalyzer`, which is a central component. This aligns with the existing architecture by making data collection more precise.

See `memory-bank/TechnicalArchitecture.md` for component details.

### Dependencies

- `src/core/analysis/constants.ts` for `SKIP_DIRECTORIES`.
- Standard Node.js `path` and `fs.Dirent`.

### Testing Approach

Unit tests will be written using Jest (assuming it's the project's test runner, as per `jest.config.js` in workspace). Mocks will be used for file system operations (`IFileOperations`) to ensure tests are fast and deterministic.

See `memory-bank/DeveloperGuide.md` for general testing guidelines.
