# Completion Report: TSK-007/Enhance Project Analysis

## Task Summary

The task to enhance the Project Analysis phase to capture more granular internal project structure in the `ProjectContext` generated by the LLM is complete and has successfully passed Code Review. This involved updating the schema, refining the LLM prompt, implementing fallback logic, and addressing code review feedback. See [[task-description-template]] for original requirements.

### Implementation Details

- **Completed**: 2025-05-02
- **Developer**: Senior Developer
- **Reviewer**: Code Reviewer

## Implementation Summary

### Changes Made

The `ProjectContext` schema and associated parsing logic (`src/core/analysis/json-schema-helper.ts`) were updated to include `definedFunctions` and `definedClasses` fields. The project analysis process now successfully extracts and processes these more granular code structure details from the LLM response. Error propagation logic in `src/core/analysis/project-analyzer.ts` was refactored for robustness. Related unit tests were updated and fixed (`tests/core/analysis/project-analyzer.prompt.test.ts`, `tests/core/analysis/project-analyzer.error.test.ts`).

### Components Modified

See [[TechnicalArchitecture#Core-Components]] for component details.

- `src/core/analysis/json-schema-helper.ts`
- `src/core/analysis/project-analyzer.ts`
- `tests/core/analysis/project-analyzer.prompt.test.ts`
- `tests/core/analysis/project-analyzer.error.test.ts`

### Technical Decisions

- Updated Zod schema for `ProjectContext` to include `definedFunctions` and `definedClasses`.
- Refactored error propagation in `project-analyzer.ts`.

## Verification

### Requirements Check

All acceptance criteria were verified as satisfied based on successful Code Review and manual testing.

- AC1: The Project Analysis process successfully extracts more granular code structure details. ✅ Satisfied.
- AC2: The `ProjectContext` schema is updated to include the new details. ✅ Satisfied.
- AC3: The LLM prompt effectively guides the LLM to provide the granular details in the `ProjectContext`. ✅ Satisfied.
- AC4: The enhanced `ProjectContext` contains demonstrably more detailed information about internal project structure. ✅ Satisfied.

### Testing Completed

- **Unit Tests**: Passing (`tests/core/analysis/project-analyzer.prompt.test.ts`, `tests/core/analysis/project-analyzer.error.test.ts`)
- **Integration Tests**: N/A
- **Coverage**: N/A

### Quality Checks

- **Code Review**: APPROVED (after two rounds)
- **Standards**: N/A
- **Documentation**: Implementation plan and Code Review document are available.

## Follow-up

### Known Issues

None explicitly mentioned in the Architect's final completion report.

### Future Improvements

Update `memory-bank/DeveloperGuide.md`'s section on Project Analysis to reflect the enhanced `ProjectContext` structure (`definedFunctions`, `definedClasses`). Consider adding an example of the enhanced `ProjectContext` JSON structure.

### Dependencies Updated
