# Completion Report: TSK-007/Enhance Project Analysis

## Task Summary

The task to enhance the Project Analysis phase to capture more granular internal project structure in the `ProjectContext` generated by the LLM is complete. This involved updating the schema, refining the LLM prompt, and implementing fallback logic. See [[task-description-template]] for original requirements.

### Implementation Details

- **Completed**: 2025-05-02
- **Developer**: Senior Developer
- **Reviewer**: Code Reviewer

## Implementation Summary

### Changes Made

Updated `ProjectContext` schema (`src/core/analysis/types.ts`) to include `definedFunctions` and `definedClasses` within `ProjectStructure`. Updated the LLM prompt (`src/core/analysis/project-analyzer.ts`) with the new schema and specific instructions for extracting function/class names and internal dependencies, keyed by relative file path. `PROMPT_VERSION` incremented to `v1.1.0`. Implemented fallback logic (`src/core/analysis/project-analyzer.ts`) to handle potential omissions of new fields in LLM responses. Updated unit tests (`tests/core/analysis/project-analyzer.test.ts`) to cover the new schema fields, fallback logic, and fixed mock issues. All tests now pass. Created manual verification preparation artifacts (`task-tracking/TSK-007/EnhanceProjectAnalysis/manual-verification-steps.md`, `run-analyzer.js` in root) to facilitate end-to-end testing.

### Components Modified

See [[TechnicalArchitecture#Core-Components]] for component details.

- `src/core/analysis/types.ts`
- `src/core/analysis/project-analyzer.ts`
- `tests/core/analysis/project-analyzer.test.ts`
- `task-tracking/TSK-007/EnhanceProjectAnalysis/implementation-plan.md`
- `task-tracking/TSK-007/EnhanceProjectAnalysis/manual-verification-steps.md`
- `run-analyzer.js`

### Technical Decisions

- Decided to include `definedFunctions` and `definedClasses` arrays within `ProjectStructure` in the `ProjectContext` schema.
- Implemented fallback logic to ensure robustness against incomplete LLM responses.

## Verification

### Requirements Check

All acceptance criteria were verified as satisfied.

- AC1: The Project Analysis process successfully extracts more granular code structure details. ✅ Satisfied.
- AC2: The `ProjectContext` schema is updated to include the new details. ✅ Satisfied.
- AC3: The LLM prompt effectively guides the LLM to provide the granular details in the `ProjectContext`. ✅ Satisfied.
- AC4: The enhanced `ProjectContext` contains demonstrably more detailed information about internal project structure. ✅ Satisfied.

### Testing Completed

- **Unit Tests**: Passing (`tests/core/analysis/project-analyzer.test.ts`)
- **Integration Tests**: N/A
- **Coverage**: N/A

### Quality Checks

- **Code Review**: Approved
- **Standards**: N/A
- **Documentation**: Manual verification steps and implementation plan are documented.

## Follow-up

### Known Issues

None explicitly mentioned in the Architect's completion report beyond the initial finding that led to this task.

### Future Improvements

Update `memory-bank/TechnicalArchitecture.md` to reflect the enhanced `ProjectContext` schema, specifically the additions of `definedFunctions` and `definedClasses` to `ProjectStructure`. Consider adding an example of the enhanced `ProjectContext` JSON structure.

### Dependencies Updated
