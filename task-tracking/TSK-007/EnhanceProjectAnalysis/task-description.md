# Task Description: TSK-007/Enhance Project Analysis

## Overview

Enhance the Project Analysis phase to capture more granular internal project structure in the `ProjectContext` generated by the LLM. This is a follow-up task based on findings from TSK-006, where the current ProjectContext was found to lack sufficient detail for generating comprehensive memory bank content.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- Modify the Project Analysis process to extract more detailed information about code structure (functions, classes, internal dependencies).
- Update the `ProjectContext` schema to accommodate the new granular details.
- Refine the LLM prompt used in Project Analysis to instruct the LLM to provide these granular details in the `ProjectContext` JSON output.

### Technical Requirements

- Modify existing code in the `src/core/analysis` directory, particularly `project-analyzer.ts` and potentially related files.
- Update the JSON schema definition for `ProjectContext`.
- Update the LLM prompt template used for Project Analysis.

## Scope

### Included

- Modification of Project Analysis logic.
- Updates to `ProjectContext` schema.
- Refinement of the LLM prompt for Project Analysis.
- Ensuring backward compatibility with existing `ProjectContext` usage where possible.

### Excluded

- Implementing changes in generators that consume `ProjectContext` (this will be a separate task).
- Comprehensive refactoring of the entire analysis module.

### Affected Components

See [[TechnicalArchitecture]] for component details.

- src/core/analysis/project-analyzer.ts
- src/core/analysis/interfaces.ts (for ProjectContext schema)
- Potentially other files in src/core/analysis depending on implementation details.
- LLM prompt templates related to Project Analysis.

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies

This task depends on the existing Project Analysis and LLM interaction logic.

### Task Dependencies

This task is a follow-up to TSK-006 (Manual Testing Foundation). Future tasks to leverage the enhanced ProjectContext will depend on this task.

## Success Criteria

- The Project Analysis process successfully extracts more granular code structure details.
- The `ProjectContext` schema is updated to include the new details.
- The LLM prompt effectively guides the LLM to provide the granular details in the `ProjectContext`.
- The enhanced `ProjectContext` contains demonstrably more detailed information about internal project structure.

## Additional Context

### Business Context

Improving the detail in the `ProjectContext` will enable the generation of more accurate and comprehensive memory bank content and potentially improve the quality of output from other generators that utilize ProjectContext.

### Technical Context

This task directly addresses a limitation identified during manual testing and is crucial for improving the effectiveness of the memory bank and other LLM-based generation processes.
