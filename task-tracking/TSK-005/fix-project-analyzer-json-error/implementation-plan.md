# Implementation Plan: Fix Project Analyzer JSON Parsing Error

**Task ID:** TSK-005  
**Task Name:** fix-project-analyzer-json-error  
**Status:** Completed  
**Current Subtask:** Documentation Updates  
**Dependencies:** None

## 1. Overview

This plan addresses the JSON parsing error in the `ProjectAnalyzer` by implementing an input prioritization strategy. The error is likely caused by exceeding the LLM's context window when analyzing large codebases, leading to truncated or malformed JSON responses. The chosen approach will modify the file collection process to prioritize key project files and limit the total input size sent to the LLM, mitigating context window issues while aiming to retain the most critical project information for accurate analysis.

## 2. Implementation Strategy

The core strategy is to modify the `ProjectAnalyzer` to intelligently select and include project files within the LLM's context window. This involves:

1. **Root Cause Confirmation:** Perform initial investigation steps to confirm that context window limitations are indeed the primary cause of the JSON parsing errors. This includes measuring token counts and observing raw LLM responses.
2. **File Prioritization Logic:** Implement logic within `ProjectAnalyzer` to categorize files based on predefined criteria (e.g., file extension, path patterns, file size) and prioritize their inclusion.
3. **Token Limit Enforcement:** Calculate the available token space for file content (total context window minus prompt tokens) and include files based on priority until this limit is reached.
4. **Prompt Adjustment:** Modify the prompt sent to the LLM to inform it that the provided codebase might be a partial representation and guide it to focus analysis on the included content.
5. **Testing:** Update existing unit tests and add new ones to verify the file prioritization logic, token limit enforcement, and successful JSON parsing with truncated input.

This approach provides a pragmatic solution to the context window issue by ensuring the most relevant files are analyzed, offering a balance between complexity and effectiveness compared to more complex methods like chunking.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria Mapping
