# Implementation Plan: Fix Project Analyzer JSON Parsing Error

**Task ID:** TSK-005
**Task Name:** fix-project-analyzer-json-error
**Status:** In Progress
**Current Subtask:** Addressing Code Review Findings
**Dependencies:** None

## 1. Overview

This plan addresses the JSON parsing error in the `ProjectAnalyzer` by implementing an input prioritization strategy. The error is likely caused by exceeding the LLM's context window when analyzing large codebases, leading to truncated or malformed JSON responses. The chosen approach will modify the file collection process to prioritize key project files and limit the total input size sent to the LLM, mitigating context window issues while aiming to retain the most critical project information for accurate analysis.

## 2. Implementation Strategy

The core strategy is to modify the `ProjectAnalyzer` to intelligently select and include project files within the LLM's context window. This involves:

1. **Root Cause Confirmation:** Perform initial investigation steps to confirm that context window limitations are indeed the primary cause of the JSON parsing errors. This includes measuring token counts and observing raw LLM responses.
2. **File Prioritization Logic:** Implement logic within `ProjectAnalyzer` to categorize files based on predefined criteria (e.g., file extension, path patterns, file size) and prioritize their inclusion.
3. **Token Limit Enforcement:** Calculate the available token space for file content (total context window minus prompt tokens) and include files based on priority until this limit is reached.
4. **Prompt Adjustment:** Modify the prompt sent to the LLM to inform it that the provided codebase might be a partial representation and guide it to focus analysis on the included content.
5. **Testing:** Update existing unit tests and add new ones to verify the file prioritization logic, token limit enforcement, and successful JSON parsing with truncated input.

This approach provides a pragmatic solution to the context window issue by ensuring the most relevant files are analyzed, offering a balance between complexity and effectiveness compared to more complex methods like chunking.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria Mapping

### Overall Assessment

**Status:** NEEDS CHANGES

The current implementation introduces critical TypeScript compilation errors that block manual testing and validation of the `analyzeProject` workflow. Key issues in dependency injection, interface mismatches, and test signatures must be resolved before proceeding with JSON parsing verification, file prioritization checks, and token-limit enforcement tests.

### Key Issues

1. **DI Registration in core-module.ts**

   - `ResponseParser` constructor now requires `IJsonSchemaHelper` but DI factory only provides `ILogger`.
   - `ProjectAnalyzer` constructor signature requires both `IFileContentCollector` and `IFilePrioritizer`, but DI factory only passes five dependencies.

2. **FilePrioritizer Test Mismatches**

   - The `prioritizeFiles` method signature accepts `FileMetadata[]`, yet existing tests pass `string[]`, causing type errors.

3. **LLM Provider Interface Inconsistencies**

   - Factories in `llm-module.ts` return providers missing `getContextWindowSize` and `countTokens`.
   - `BaseLLMProvider` does not implement these methods, violating the `ILLMProvider` interface.
   - Provider registry tests expect `ILLMProvider` implementations to include these methods.

4. **Build Failures Prevent Manual Testing**
   - Without successful compilation, we cannot run `analyzeProject` to capture debug logs for JSON parsing, file ordering, or token usage.

### Recommendations

1. **Update DI Bindings**

   - In `core-module.ts`, inject `IJsonSchemaHelper` into the `ResponseParser` factory.
   - Inject `IFileContentCollector` and `IFilePrioritizer` into the `ProjectAnalyzer` factory registration.

2. **Align FilePrioritizer API and Tests**

   - Modify tests to supply `FileMetadata` objects, or adjust `prioritizeFiles` to accept `string[]` as intended.

3. **Ensure LLM Providers Conform to ILLMProvider**

   - Add `getContextWindowSize` and `countTokens` implementations to `BaseLLMProvider` and all concrete providers.
   - Update factories in `llm-module.ts` and tests to expect the correct provider shape.

4. **Rebuild and Rerun Manual Tests**

   - After DI and interface fixes, rebuild the project (`npm run build`).
   - Rerun debug logging for `analyzeProject` and capture logs for JSON parsing errors, file prioritization order, and token-limit enforcement.
   - Validate error recovery by feeding malformed LLM responses.

5. **Documentation Updates**
   - Once code changes are in place, update `memory-bank/DeveloperGuide.md` with instructions for new JSON schema validation and content collector behavior.
