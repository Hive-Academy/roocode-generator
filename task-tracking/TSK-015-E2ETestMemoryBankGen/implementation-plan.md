# Implementation Plan: TSK-015/E2ETestMemoryBankGen

## 1. Overview

This plan outlines the steps to perform an end-to-end test of the `roocode-generator` project's build process (`npm run build`) and the memory bank generation pipeline (`npm start -- generate -- -g memory-bank`). The goal is to verify that both processes execute successfully and that the memory bank files are updated as expected.

See [task-description.md](./task-description.md) for detailed requirements and context.

## 2. Implementation Strategy

### Approach

The testing process involves executing a sequence of npm commands in the project root directory:

1.  Ensure dependencies are installed (`npm install`).
2.  Execute the build script (`npm run build`).
3.  Execute the memory bank generator script (`npm start -- generate -- -g memory-bank`).
4.  Verify the success of each command by checking console output for errors.
5.  Verify the expected file updates in the `memory-bank/` directory.
6.  Compile the results into a summary report.

### Key Components

- **Scripts**: `npm install`, `npm run build`, `npm start` (as defined in `package.json`).
- **Build Output**: `dist/` directory (verification of build success).
- **Generator**: Memory Bank Generator (invoked via CLI).
- **Affected Files**: `memory-bank/ProjectOverview.md`, `memory-bank/TechnicalArchitecture.md`, `memory-bank/DeveloperGuide.md`.
- **Verification**: Console output, file timestamps/`git status`.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria Mapping

- **AC1: Build Success:** Verified in Subtask 2.
- **AC2: Generator Execution Success:** Verified in Subtask 3.
- **AC3: File Generation/Update:** Verified in Subtask 4.
- **AC4: Output Verification Report:** Completed by the Architect in Subtask 5 after successful completion of Subtasks 1-4.

## 4. Implementation Subtasks

### 1. Ensure Dependencies

**Status**: Not Started

**Description**: Run `npm install` to ensure all project dependencies are correctly installed and up-to-date before proceeding with the build and generation steps.

**Files to Modify**:

- `package-lock.json` (potentially updated by npm)

**Implementation Details**:

```bash
# Execute in the project root directory (/projects/roocode-generator)
npm install
```

**Testing Requirements**:

- Verify the command completes successfully without any critical error messages in the console output.

**Related Acceptance Criteria**: Prerequisite for AC1, AC2.

**Estimated effort**: < 5 minutes

**Required Delegation Components**:

- Implementation components for Junior Coder: None.
- Testing components for Junior Tester: None.
- This subtask should be executed directly by the Senior Developer.

**Delegation Success Criteria**: Command executed successfully.

### 2. Execute Build & Verify AC1

**Status**: Not Started

**Description**: Execute the project build script (`npm run build`) and verify its successful completion according to AC1.

**Files to Modify**:

- None directly. The `dist/` directory will be created/updated.

**Implementation Details**:

```bash
# Execute in the project root directory (/projects/roocode-generator)
npm run build
```

**Testing Requirements**:

- Observe the console output.
- Confirm the build process finishes without any errors.
- Confirm the presence of expected build artifacts in the `dist/` directory.

**Related Acceptance Criteria**:

- AC1: `npm run build` completes successfully without errors.

**Estimated effort**: 5-10 minutes

**Required Delegation Components**:

- Implementation components for Junior Coder: None.
- Testing components for Junior Tester: None.
- This subtask should be executed directly by the Senior Developer.

**Delegation Success Criteria**: Command executed successfully, console output confirms no errors, AC1 met.

### 3. Execute Memory Bank Generation & Verify AC2

**Status**: Not Started

**Description**: Execute the memory bank generator script (`npm start -- generate -- -g memory-bank`) and verify its successful completion according to AC2.

**Files to Modify**:

- `memory-bank/ProjectOverview.md`
- `memory-bank/TechnicalArchitecture.md`
- `memory-bank/DeveloperGuide.md`

**Implementation Details**:

```bash
# Execute in the project root directory (/projects/roocode-generator)
npm start -- generate -- -g memory-bank
```

**Testing Requirements**:

- Observe the console output.
- Confirm the generator process finishes without any runtime errors.

**Related Acceptance Criteria**:

- AC2: `npm start -- generate -- -g memory-bank` completes successfully without errors.

**Estimated effort**: 10-15 minutes

**Required Delegation Components**:

- Implementation components for Junior Coder: None.
- Testing components for Junior Tester: None.
- This subtask should be executed directly by the Senior Developer.

**Delegation Success Criteria**: Command executed successfully, console output confirms no errors, AC2 met.

### 4. Verify File Updates (AC3)

**Status**: Not Started

**Description**: Verify that the memory bank files (`ProjectOverview.md`, `TechnicalArchitecture.md`, `DeveloperGuide.md`) were generated or updated by the generator command, satisfying AC3.

**Files to Modify**:

- None.

**Implementation Details**:

- Check the modification timestamps of the files in the `memory-bank/` directory.
- Alternatively, use `git status` to observe changes to these files.

**Testing Requirements**:

- Confirm that the three specified memory bank files show recent modification times corresponding to the execution of Subtask 3, or appear as modified in `git status`.

**Related Acceptance Criteria**:

- AC3: Memory bank files are generated/updated.

**Estimated effort**: < 5 minutes

**Required Delegation Components**:

- Implementation components for Junior Coder: None.
- Testing components for Junior Tester: None.
- This subtask should be executed directly by the Senior Developer.

**Delegation Success Criteria**: Evidence confirms files were updated, AC3 met.

### 5. Create Summary Report (AC4)

**Status**: Not Started

**Description**: Compile the results from the previous subtasks into a final summary report confirming the status of AC1, AC2, and AC3, and provide a brief assessment of the generated files' reasonableness. This step is performed by the Architect.

**Files to Modify**:

- This implementation plan (potentially updated with results) or included in the final completion message.

**Implementation Details**:

- Review the outcomes reported by the Senior Developer for Subtasks 1-4.
- Briefly inspect the content of the updated memory bank files for obvious errors or omissions.
- Prepare the final report confirming AC1-AC3 status.

**Testing Requirements**:

- Ensure the report accurately reflects the test execution results.

**Related Acceptance Criteria**:

- AC4: A summary report confirming AC1-AC3 and providing a brief assessment of the generated files is created.

**Estimated effort**: 5 minutes

**Required Delegation Components**:

- This subtask is performed by the Architect.

**Delegation Success Criteria**: N/A.

## 5. Implementation Sequence

1.  **Subtask 1**: Ensure Dependencies
2.  **Subtask 2**: Execute Build & Verify AC1
3.  **Subtask 3**: Execute Memory Bank Generation & Verify AC2
4.  **Subtask 4**: Verify File Updates (AC3)
5.  **Subtask 5**: Create Summary Report (AC4) (Architect task)

## 6. Testing Strategy

This task _is_ the testing strategy. Verification relies on:

- Observing console output for success/error messages for `npm install`, `npm run build`, and `npm start -- generate -- -g memory-bank`.
- Checking file system timestamps or `git status` for `memory-bank/*.md` files.
- Architect's final review and report generation.

## 7. Implementation Checklist

- [x] Requirements reviewed (from task-description.md)
- [x] Architecture reviewed (N/A for execution task)
- [x] Dependencies checked (Handled in Subtask 1)
- [x] Tests planned (This task _is_ the test)
- [ ] Documentation planned (Summary report in Subtask 5)
