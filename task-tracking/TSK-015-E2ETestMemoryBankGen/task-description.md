# Task Description: TSK-015 - End-to-End Test of Build and Memory Bank Generation

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-05-05
**Author:** Boomerang (Technical Lead)

## 1. Task Overview

**Goal:** Perform an end-to-end test cycle to evaluate the project build process, the project analyzer's integration, and the memory bank generator's execution and output.

**Background:** Following an investigation into potential analysis redundancy (TSK-014, concluded no action needed), we are initiating this test cycle to ensure the core build and memory bank generation pipeline is functioning correctly.

**Task Categorization:** Testing / Verification
**Priority:** High

## 2. Current Implementation Analysis

This task involves executing existing commands and observing their behavior. The key components involved are:
- The project's build configuration (likely `vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`).
- The `npm run build` script defined in `package.json`.
- The CLI entry point (`src/core/cli/cli-main.ts`).
- The `GeneratorOrchestrator` (`src/core/application/generator-orchestrator.ts`).
- The `MemoryBankGenerator` (likely in `src/generators/`).
- The `ProjectAnalyzer` (`src/core/analysis/project-analyzer.ts`) and its dependencies (`AstAnalysisService`, `TreeSitterParserService`, etc.), as they are invoked by the memory bank generator.
- The `MemoryBankService` and related components (`src/memory-bank/`).

## 3. Component Structure

N/A - This task focuses on executing existing functionality, not implementing new components.

## 4. Detailed Requirements

1.  **Execute Build:** Run the command `npm run build` in the project's root directory (`/projects/roocode-generator`).
2.  **Execute Memory Bank Generation:** After a successful build, run the command `npm start -- generate -- -g memory-bank` in the project's root directory.
3.  **Observe Outputs:** Monitor the console output for both commands for any errors.
4.  **Verify File Updates:** Check if the memory bank files (`memory-bank/ProjectOverview.md`, `memory-bank/TechnicalArchitecture.md`, `memory-bank/DeveloperGuide.md`) have been modified (e.g., check timestamps or content changes).
5.  **Report Findings:** Document the success or failure of each step and provide a brief assessment of the generated/updated memory bank files.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria Checklist

-   [ ] **AC1: Build Success:** The `npm run build` command executes and completes successfully without any build errors reported in the console output.
    -   **Verification Method:** Observe console output of `npm run build`.
-   [ ] **AC2: Generator Execution Success:** The `npm start -- generate -- -g memory-bank` command executes and completes successfully without any runtime errors reported in the console output.
    -   **Verification Method:** Observe console output of `npm start -- generate -- -g memory-bank`.
-   [ ] **AC3: File Generation/Update:** The memory bank files (`/projects/roocode-generator/memory-bank/ProjectOverview.md`, `/projects/roocode-generator/memory-bank/TechnicalArchitecture.md`, `/projects/roocode-generator/memory-bank/DeveloperGuide.md`) are generated or updated by the generator command.
    -   **Verification Method:** Check file timestamps or use `git status` after the generator command completes.
-   [ ] **AC4: Output Verification Report:** A summary report is provided confirming the successful execution of both commands and an initial assessment that the generated/updated memory bank files appear reasonable (no obvious errors/omissions).
    -   **Verification Method:** Review the report provided by the Architect upon completion.

## 6. Implementation Guidance

-   Ensure all dependencies are installed (`npm install`) before running the commands.
-   Execute commands from the project root directory (`/projects/roocode-generator`).
-   Capture the console output of both commands, especially if errors occur.
-   The implementation plan should simply outline the steps to execute the commands and verify the criteria.

## 7. File and Component References

-   `package.json` (for `build` and `start` scripts)
-   `memory-bank/ProjectOverview.md`
-   `memory-bank/TechnicalArchitecture.md`
-   `memory-bank/DeveloperGuide.md`
-   `src/core/analysis/project-analyzer.ts`
-   `src/memory-bank/memory-bank-service.ts` (and related memory bank components)
-   `src/generators/` (location of `MemoryBankGenerator`)

## 8. Memory Bank References

-   `memory-bank/DeveloperGuide.md`: Sections related to building and running the application/generators.
