# Completion Report: TSK-006/Manual Testing Foundation

## Task Summary

The task to perform manual testing on the core business logic of the roocode-generator and document the findings is complete. This involved testing the `generate -g memory-bank` command flow, covering Project Analysis, LLM Interaction, and Memory Bank Operations. See [[task-description-template]] for original requirements.

### Implementation Details

- **Completed**: 2025-05-02
- **Developer**: N/A (Manual Testing performed by Code Reviewer)
- **Reviewer**: N/A (Verified by Boomerang)

## Implementation Summary

### Changes Made

Build errors related to types and exports were fixed by the Senior Developer. Runtime errors related to JSON validation (handling nulls from LLM) and configuration (memory bank path) were resolved by the Senior Developer. Manual testing of the `generate -g memory-bank` command was successfully executed after fixes.

### Components Modified

See [[TechnicalArchitecture#Core-Components]] for component details.

- src/core/analysis/project-analyzer.ts
- src/core/llm/providers/google-genai-provider.ts
- src/memory-bank/interfaces.ts
- Various test files

### Technical Decisions

- Implemented `applyProjectContextDefaults` helper for robust JSON parsing.
- Ensured correct memory bank output directory configuration.

## Verification

### Requirements Check

All acceptance criteria were verified as satisfied.

- AC1: A comprehensive set of manual test cases is documented. ✅ Satisfied.
- AC2: Each test case includes clear steps and expected outcomes. ✅ Satisfied.
- AC3: The documented test cases cover the core business logic areas identified. ✅ Satisfied.

### Testing Completed

- **Unit Tests**: N/A (Manual testing task)
- **Integration Tests**: N/A (Manual testing task)
- **Coverage**: N/A (Manual testing task)

### Quality Checks

- **Code Review**: Approved (as per Architect's report).
- **Standards**: N/A (Manual testing task).
- **Documentation**: Manual testing report created at `task-tracking/TSK-006/ManualTestingFoundation/manual-testing-report.md`.

## Follow-up

### Known Issues

The current `ProjectContext` generated by the LLM lacks sufficient detail about internal project structure, leading to rigid memory bank content.

### Future Improvements

Enhance the Project Analysis phase by expanding the `ProjectContext` schema and refining the LLM prompt to capture more granular internal project details (e.g., specific functions, classes, internal dependencies).

### Dependencies Updated
