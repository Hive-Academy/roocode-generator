# Task Description: TSK-006/Manual Testing Foundation

## Overview

Create a set of manual test cases to verify the core business logic of the roocode-generator project, focusing on project analysis, LLM interaction, and memory bank operations. This will establish a baseline for the current functionality and provide a solid foundation for future development and automated testing.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- Define manual test steps for project analysis (file collection, prioritization).
- Define manual test steps for LLM interaction (prompting, response handling).
- Define manual test steps for memory bank operations (read, write, update).
- Define expected outcomes for each test step.

### Technical Requirements

N/A (This is a manual testing task, no code changes are required as part of this task).

## Scope

### Included

- Manual test cases for core project analysis logic.
- Manual test cases for core LLM interaction logic.
- Manual test cases for core memory bank file operations.
- Definition of expected results for each test case.

### Excluded

- Automated test case implementation.
- Testing of specific generator logic (e.g., ai-magic, roomodes).
- Performance or load testing.
- Security testing.

### Affected Components

See [[TechnicalArchitecture]] for component details.

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies

N/A

### Task Dependencies

None

## Success Criteria

- A comprehensive set of manual test cases is documented.
- Each test case includes clear steps and expected outcomes.
- The documented test cases cover the core business logic areas identified.

## Additional Context

### Business Context

Establishing a verified baseline of current functionality is essential before adding new features or refactoring existing code. This manual testing effort will provide confidence in the core components.

### Technical Context

The current phase of the project involves solidifying the core architecture and ensuring the foundational pieces are working correctly before expanding capabilities.
