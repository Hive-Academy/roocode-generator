# Manual Testing Report - TSK-006: Core Business Logic

**Date:** 2025-05-02
**Task:** REDELEGATION (Attempt 4): Manual Testing Execution: TSK-006 - Core Business Logic

## Verification of Build & Tests

- `npm run build`: **Success**. The build completed without errors.
- `npm test`: **Skipped verification** as per task instructions, but the command was attempted. (Note: The user provided feedback indicating a focus shift before the test results were fully processed).

## Execution of Core Functionalities Manually

The core functionality for generating the memory bank was executed successfully using `node bin/roocode-generator.js generate -g memory-bank`.

- **Project Analysis**: Completed successfully.
- **LLM Interaction**: Successfully called the LLM (OpenRouter with google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview) for project analysis and content generation.
- **Memory Bank Operations**: The memory bank files (`ProjectOverview.md`, `TechnicalArchitecture.md`, `DeveloperGuide.md`) were generated and saved to the `./memory-bank` directory as expected. The `./memory-bank/templates` directory was also created.

## Analysis of Generated Memory Bank Content and ProjectContext

Upon reviewing the generated memory bank files, the content was found to be high-level and somewhat generic, lacking specific details about the project's internal structure and components.

To diagnose this, the `ProjectContext` JSON object generated by the `ProjectAnalyzer` was captured from the debug logs of a successful run.

**ProjectContext JSON Analysis:**

The captured `ProjectContext` JSON accurately identified the external tech stack, main directories, entry points, and external dependencies. However, the fields intended for capturing internal structure (`componentStructure`) and internal dependencies (`internalDependencies`) were empty.

**Conclusion:**

The rigidity of the generated memory bank content is primarily due to the **lack of detailed internal project structure and dependency information in the `ProjectContext` JSON generated by the `ProjectAnalyzer`**. The LLM, when generating the memory bank content, is limited by the information provided in the `ProjectContext`.

## Issues Found

- **Issue:** Generated memory bank content is rigid and lacks detailed internal project information.
  - **Impact:** The generated documentation is not as valuable as it could be for understanding the project's codebase.
  - **Root Cause:** The `ProjectContext` generated by the `ProjectAnalyzer` does not capture sufficient detail about the project's internal structure and dependencies.

## Proposed Next Steps

To address the issue of rigid memory bank output and make the generated documentation richer, the following steps are recommended:

1.  **Expand the `ProjectContext` schema:** Modify the schema to include fields for capturing internal modules, components, their responsibilities, and dependencies.
2.  **Refine the LLM prompt in `ProjectAnalyzer`:** Update the system prompt to guide the LLM in identifying and extracting the detailed internal project information according to the expanded schema.
3.  **Evaluate file collection/prioritization:** Review the file collection and prioritization logic to ensure relevant files for inferring internal structure are included in the LLM context.

A separate task should be created for the Architect to address these points and potentially design a more robust logging system as discussed.

## Acceptance Criteria Verification

- Build and automated test status confirmed: **Partially Satisfied** (Build confirmed, test status noted but verification skipped as per instructions).
- Core functionalities (Project Analysis, LLM Interaction, Memory Bank) manually executed successfully, with results documented: **Satisfied**.
- The manual testing report at `task-tracking/TSK-006/ManualTestingFoundation/manual-testing-report.md` is updated comprehensively with findings from this successful attempt: **Satisfied**.
