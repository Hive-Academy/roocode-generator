# Completion Report: TSK-008 (Revised) - Integrate Tree-sitter for Generic AST Extraction

## 1. Task Summary

This task successfully integrated Tree-sitter into the `ProjectAnalyzer` to generate a generic Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation (`astData`) for supported source files (`.ts`, `.js`). This replaces the previous, query-based approach for function/class extraction, aligning with the strategic pivot confirmed after TSK-012. The generated `astData` provides foundational structural context for future LLM-based code analysis.

- **Revised Task Description:** `task-tracking/TSK-008/EnhanceProjectAnalyzerWithTreeSitter/task-description-revised.md`
- **Implementation Plan:** `task-tracking/TSK-008/EnhanceProjectAnalyzerWithTreeSitter/implementation-plan.md`
- **Code Review:** `task-tracking/TSK-008/EnhanceProjectAnalyzerWithTreeSitter/code-review.md` (Status: APPROVED)

## 2. Implementation Details

- **Completed**: 2025-05-05
- **Developer(s)**: Senior Developer, Junior Tester (Mock Fixes) - Delegated via Architect
- **Reviewer**: Code Review Mode

### Changes Made:

- Defined `GenericAstNode` interface.
- Updated `ProjectContext` interface to include `astData` and remove deprecated fields.
- Implemented recursive AST traversal and conversion to `GenericAstNode` in `TreeSitterParserService`.
- Updated `TreeSitterParserService.parse` to return the generic AST root node.
- Integrated the updated parser into `ProjectAnalyzer`, populating the `astData` field.
- Removed stale references to deprecated types/fields (`ParsedCodeInfo`, `CodeElementInfo`, `definedFunctions`, `definedClasses`) from source and test files.
- Updated and fixed unit tests for `TreeSitterParserService` and `ProjectAnalyzer`.
- Added debug logging to confirm `astData` presence in final `ProjectContext`.

### Components Modified:

- `src/core/analysis/types.ts`
- `src/core/analysis/tree-sitter-parser.service.ts`
- `src/core/analysis/project-analyzer.ts`
- `tests/core/analysis/*` (multiple test files updated/fixed)

## 3. Acceptance Criteria Verification

All acceptance criteria from the **revised** task description were verified and met, with AC10 noted as deferred by user acceptance:

- **AC1:** Analyzer runs. ✅ (Verified via logs/user confirmation)
- **AC2:** Output JSON contains `astData`. ✅ (Verified via logs/manual check)
- **AC3:** `astData` keys are relative paths. ✅
- **AC4:** `astData` value is `GenericAstNode`. ✅
- **AC5:** `GenericAstNode` includes `text`. ✅
- **AC6:** `GenericAstNode` includes positions. ✅
- **AC7:** Unsupported files skipped. ✅
- **AC8:** Parse errors handled & logged. ✅
- **AC9:** Other fields preserved, old fields removed. ✅
- **AC10:** Unit tests updated/fixed. ✅ (Note: User accepted deferral of fixing _all_ potential test debt, but core tests related to this task pass).
- **AC11:** Interfaces updated. ✅

Verification confirmed by Code Review document (Status: APPROVED) and manual checks based on user feedback/logs.

## 4. Memory Bank Updates

The following updates were made to the memory bank:

1.  **`memory-bank/TechnicalArchitecture.md`**:
    - Updated description of `ProjectAnalyzer` (line 130) to reflect usage of `TreeSitterParserService` for generic AST generation (`astData`).
    - Updated description of `types.ts` (line 132) to mention `GenericAstNode` and `astData`.
    - Updated Data Flow description (line 200) to include the AST generation step.
2.  **`memory-bank/DeveloperGuide.md`**:
    - Added new Section 8 ("Generic AST Extraction (Tree-sitter)") describing the `GenericAstNode` structure and the generation process (inserted at line 549).
3.  **`memory-bank/ProjectOverview.md`**:
    - Updated the "Project Context Analysis" bullet point (line 46) to mention the new capability of generating detailed AST data using Tree-sitter.

## 5. Redelegation History

- **Redelegation 1:** Rejected due to Code Review status "NEEDS CHANGES" (build errors blocking AC1, AC10).
- **Redelegation 2:** Rejected due to missing `astData` field in final output (AC2 not met).

## 6. Follow-up Items

- **Unit Test Debt:** Address any remaining, unrelated unit test failures deferred from this task (as noted in registry).
- **LLM Analysis Task:** Create and prioritize a new task to implement the LLM-based analysis of the generated `astData`.
- **(Low Priority)** Add integration tests verifying the actual JSON output.
