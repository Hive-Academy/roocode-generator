# Task Description: On-the-Fly Creation of roocode-config.json with Defaults (In-Memory)

## Background

The current generator startup process assumes the presence of a `roocode-config.json` file at the root of the working directory. This assumption is incorrect and can cause failures or confusion if the file is missing.

## Objective

Investigate the generator's configuration loading mechanism and implement a feature to provide a default configuration object on the fly with sensible default values if the physical `roocode-config.json` file does not exist at startup. This should ensure smooth generator operation without requiring any physical config file.

## Functional Requirements

- Detect absence of `roocode-config.json` at the root of the working directory during generator startup.
- Instead of creating a physical file, maintain an in-memory default configuration object with correct default values.
- Use this in-memory config object to proceed with generator initialization and execution.
- Ensure no disruption or errors occur due to missing config file.
- Provide clear logging or user feedback about the use of default in-memory config.
- Include unit and integration tests covering this new behavior.

## Technical Requirements

- Investigate and modify the `ProjectConfigService` or equivalent component responsible for loading the project configuration.
- Define a default configuration schema and values consistent with existing expectations.
- Implement logic to return the default config object when the physical config file is missing, without creating any file.
- Follow existing coding standards, DI patterns, and error handling conventions.
- Update relevant documentation if necessary.

## Success Criteria

- The generator no longer fails or errors out when `roocode-config.json` is missing.
- The default in-memory config object is used automatically and correctly.
- Tests verify the new behavior.
- Documentation reflects the change.
