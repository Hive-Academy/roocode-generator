# Implementation Plan: TSK-010/UpdateReadme

## Overview

This plan outlines the steps to update the main `README.md` file to align with the current project state and the refined memory bank documentation (`ProjectOverview.md`, `TechnicalArchitecture.md`, `DeveloperGuide.md` from TSK-009). The goal is to ensure the README provides accurate, up-to-date information for project setup, usage, and contribution.

See [task-description.md](./task-description.md) for detailed requirements and acceptance criteria.

## Implementation Strategy

### Approach

The implementation involves editing the `README.md` file section by section. Each section will be updated based on the content of the corresponding refined memory bank documents (`ProjectOverview.md`, `TechnicalArchitecture.md`, `DeveloperGuide.md`). After editing, each change will be verified against the specific acceptance criteria outlined in the task description.

### Key Components

- **Affected Areas**:
  - `README.md` (Primary file for modification)
- **Dependencies**:
  - `memory-bank/ProjectOverview.md` (Source for overview section)
  - `memory-bank/TechnicalArchitecture.md` (Source for "How it Works" and release process sections)
  - `memory-bank/DeveloperGuide.md` (Source for setup, testing, and release process sections)
  - `package.json` (To verify npm script names for the "Running Tests" section)
- **Risk Areas**:
  - Ensuring complete accuracy and consistency between `README.md` and the source memory bank documents.
  - Correctly interpreting and summarizing information from the source documents.
  - Verifying the actual behavior of commands (e.g., `roocode generate` default) matches the updated description.
  - Ensuring all relative links are correct.

## Acceptance Criteria Mapping

This task focuses on updating a single file based on multiple sources and criteria. The single subtask below covers all requirements. Verification involves comparing the final `README.md` against each acceptance criterion (AC1-AC9) and the source documents.

- **AC1 (Overview):** Verify README overview matches `ProjectOverview.md` summary.
- **AC2 (How it Works):** Verify README flow description matches `TechnicalArchitecture.md`.
- **AC3 (Setup):** Verify README setup steps match `DeveloperGuide.md` (URL, npm, .env, local focus, no global install).
- **AC4 (Testing):** Verify README test commands match `DeveloperGuide.md` and `package.json` (npm only).
- **AC5 (Commands):** Verify command descriptions (`config`, `generate` default/ai-magic, deprecated `generate memory-bank` options removal) are accurate based on `ProjectOverview.md` and potentially manual command execution.
- **AC6 (Release):** Verify README release process describes `semantic-release` as per `DeveloperGuide.md`/`TechnicalArchitecture.md`.
- **AC7 (Vite Section):** Verify the Vite section is completely removed.
- **AC8 (Links):** Manually check all relative links to memory bank files point correctly from the root `README.md`.
- **AC9 (Overall):** Review the entire README for clarity, Markdown formatting, and consistency.

## Implementation Subtasks

### 1. Update README.md Content

**Status**: Completed

**Description**: Edit the `README.md` file section by section to align with the refined memory bank documents (`ProjectOverview.md`, `TechnicalArchitecture.md`, `DeveloperGuide.md`) and meet all acceptance criteria (AC1-AC9).

**Files to Modify**:

- `README.md` - Update content across multiple sections.

**Implementation Details**:

- **Project Overview Section:** Revise based on `memory-bank/ProjectOverview.md` summary.
- **How it Works Section:** Update based on command flow described in `memory-bank/TechnicalArchitecture.md`, emphasizing `AiMagicGenerator`.
- **Building/Setup Section:** Rewrite based on `memory-bank/DeveloperGuide.md`:
  - Use repository URL: `https://github.com/Hive-Academy/roocode-generator.git`.
  - Replace all `yarn` commands with equivalent `npm` commands.
  - Add step for creating/configuring `.env` file.
  - Focus on local setup (`npm install`, `npm run prepare`).
  - Remove global installation steps (`npm install -g .`, `which roocode`, `verify-installation.sh`).
  - Ensure prerequisites match `DeveloperGuide.md`.
- **Running Tests Section:** Rewrite based on `memory-bank/DeveloperGuide.md`:
  - Use only `npm` commands.
  - Verify script names (`npm test`, `npm run test:watch`, `npm run test:coverage`) against `package.json`.
- **Commands Section:** Update descriptions:
  - Clarify `roocode generate` default behavior (likely `ai-magic`). _Verification step: Run `node dist/bin/roocode-generator.js generate` locally if possible._
  - Describe `ai-magic` role accurately based on `ProjectOverview.md`.
  - Update deprecated `roocode generate memory-bank` description, removing outdated options (`--context`, `--output`).
  - Ensure `roocode config` description is accurate.
- **Release Process Section:** Rewrite based on `memory-bank/DeveloperGuide.md` and `TechnicalArchitecture.md`, describing the automated `semantic-release` process via CI. Remove manual `npm version` steps.
- **Vite Integration Section:** Delete this entire section (lines 288-302 in the original file, verify line numbers if needed).
- **Links:** Check and correct relative paths for links to `./memory-bank/ProjectOverview.md`, `./memory-bank/TechnicalArchitecture.md`, `./memory-bank/DeveloperGuide.md`.
- **Overall Review:** Read through the entire updated `README.md` for clarity, accuracy, consistency, and proper Markdown formatting.

**Testing Requirements**:

- Manual comparison of each updated section against the corresponding source document (`ProjectOverview.md`, `TechnicalArchitecture.md`, `DeveloperGuide.md`).
- Explicit verification against each Acceptance Criterion (AC1-AC9).
- Manual check of all relative links within the updated `README.md`.
- Optional: Execute `node dist/bin/roocode-generator.js generate` (after `npm run build`) to confirm default behavior description.

**Related Acceptance Criteria**:

- AC1, AC2, AC3, AC4, AC5, AC6, AC7, AC8, AC9

**Estimated effort**: 30 minutes

**Delegation Notes**: This task involves careful content editing and verification against source documents. Suitable for delegation to the Senior Developer. No specific components suitable for Junior Coder/Tester delegation.

**Redelegation History**: N/A

**Implementation Notes**:

- Updated README.md sections: Project Overview, How it Works, Setup, Running Tests, Commands, Release Process.
- Removed the inaccurate "Vite Integration Update" section.
- Corrected repository URL in Setup section.
- Replaced all `yarn` commands with `npm`.
- Added `.env` setup step.
- Removed global installation steps.
- Clarified `roocode generate` usage with `--generators <type>` flag.
- Marked `roocode generate memory-bank` as deprecated and removed old options.
- Updated Release Process section to describe `semantic-release` automation.
- Verified all relative links to memory bank documents (`./memory-bank/...`).
- Manually verified all acceptance criteria (AC1-AC9) against the final README.md and source documents. No delegation was used.

## Implementation Sequence

1.  **Update README.md Content** - This single subtask encompasses all required changes.

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture Impact

This task primarily involves documentation updates and does not directly impact the application's architecture. It ensures the README accurately reflects the existing architecture described in `TechnicalArchitecture.md`.

### Dependencies

- Accuracy relies heavily on the correctness and completeness of the refined memory bank documents from TSK-009.
- Verification of test script names depends on `package.json`.

### Testing Approach

Testing is primarily manual verification:

- Comparing the updated `README.md` content against the source memory bank documents (`ProjectOverview.md`, `TechnicalArchitecture.md`, `DeveloperGuide.md`).
- Checking each acceptance criterion (AC1-AC9) against the final `README.md`.
- Verifying the correctness of relative links.
- Optionally running commands like `roocode generate` locally to confirm descriptions.

See [[DeveloperGuide.md#Quality-and-Testing]](./memory-bank/DeveloperGuide.md#quality-and-testing) for general testing guidelines, although specific unit/integration tests are not applicable here.
