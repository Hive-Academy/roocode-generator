Memory Bank Update Recommendation: Update DeveloperGuide.md's section on Project Analysis to reflect the enhanced ProjectContext structure (definedFunctions, definedClasses). Consider adding a JSON example. |
| TSK-008 | EnhanceProjectAnalyzerWithTreeSitter (Revised: AST Extract)          | Completed   | None         | 2025-05-02 | 2025-05-05      | Implemented generic AST extraction.

Runtime blocker resolved. Redelegated once for missing code review. Follow-up: Add inline docs, implement LLM analysis, fix lint issues.                                                               |

Enhance generator to use `codeInsights` for richer documentation.                                                                                                     |

Addressing Google GenAI provider stability (token limits, retries, HTML error handling), robust JSON parsing for `codeInsights` (using `jsonrepair`), and `tsconfig.json` comment handling. Builds on TSK-018 for exclusions.                |
