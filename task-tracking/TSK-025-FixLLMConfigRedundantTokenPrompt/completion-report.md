# Completion Report: TSK-025 - Fix LLM Config Redundant Token Prompt

## 1. Task Summary

This task aimed to improve the user experience of the `npm start -- config` command by eliminating the redundant prompt for `maxTokens` when the model's context window size could be automatically determined. If determinable, `maxTokens` is now automatically set (as 25% of the context window); otherwise, the user is prompted as before.

## 2. Implementation Details

- **Primary File Modified**: [`src/core/config/llm-config.service.ts`](src/core/config/llm-config.service.ts:1)
- **Method Modified**: `promptForAdvancedConfig`
- **Key Changes**:
  - The method now attempts to call `provider.getContextWindowSize()`.
  - If `getContextWindowSize()` returns a positive value, `maxTokens` is calculated as `Math.floor(contextWindow * 0.25)`, and the user is NOT prompted for `maxTokens`.
  - If `getContextWindowSize()` fails, returns 0, or the provider/factory cannot be resolved, the user IS prompted for `maxTokens` with a default of 4096.
  - The prompt for `temperature` remains unchanged.
  - Logging was added to indicate when `maxTokens` is set automatically and to detail various scenarios of context window retrieval.
- **Tests Updated**:
  - [`tests/core/config/llm-config.service.interactive-edit.test.ts`](tests/core/config/llm-config.service.interactive-edit.test.ts:1) was significantly updated with new test cases to cover scenarios of automatic `maxTokens` setting and fallback prompting.
  - Minor updates to [`tests/core/config/llm-config.service.test.ts`](tests/core/config/llm-config.service.test.ts:1).

## 4. Delegation Effectiveness Evaluation

- **Component Breakdown**: Appropriate, focused on `LLMConfigService`.
- **Interface Definition**: Handled interactions with `ILLMProvider` (`getContextWindowSize`) effectively, including error states.
- **Integration Quality**: Seamless within `LLMConfigService`.
- **Junior Role Utilization**: Not applicable.
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Architect provided good recommendations for memory bank updates regarding provider interaction patterns.

## 5. Memory Bank Updates Made

The following insights/patterns will be added to the memory bank:

- **Pattern for Optional/Unreliable Provider Methods**:
  - When interacting with provider interface methods that might not exist, might fail, or might return indicative non-error values (e.g., 0 for "not found"):
    1.  Check for method existence if truly optional (`typeof provider.methodName === 'function'`).
    2.  Always call asynchronous methods that might reject within a `try/catch` block.
    3.  Handle various return states gracefully (e.g., a `0` value indicating "not found" vs. an actual error vs. a valid positive value).
    4.  Provide clear logging for each path to aid debugging.
- **Testing Such Interactions**:
  - Ensure mocks accurately reflect the interface contract (e.g., `Promise<number>` vs. `Result<number, Error>`).
  - Cover all success, failure (rejection), and "not found" (e.g., resolves with 0) scenarios in unit tests.
  - Verify that logging reflects these different paths.

(These will be physically added to `DeveloperGuide.md` or `TechnicalArchitecture.md` in the next step).
