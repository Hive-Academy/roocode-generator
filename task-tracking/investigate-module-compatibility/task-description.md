# Task Description: Investigate and Fix Module Compatibility Issues

## Summary

Investigate and fix runtime errors and compatibility issues related to ES modules and CommonJS interop when bundling the CLI with Vite, specifically focusing on the `ora`, `inquirer`, and `langchain` packages.

## Functional Requirements

- The CLI should execute commands (e.g., `generate`) without encountering runtime errors related to module compatibility issues with `ora`, `inquirer`, or `langchain`.
- Features relying on these packages (progress indicators, interactive prompts, LLM interactions) should function correctly after the fix.

## Technical Requirements

- Investigate the specific runtime error related to the `ora` package.
- Investigate potential ES module/CommonJS compatibility issues with the `inquirer` and `langchain` packages within the Vite build environment. This may involve:
  - Examining error messages and stack traces when these packages are used.
  - Checking package documentation and known issues related to bundling or Node.js environments.
  - Experimenting with Vite configuration options (e.g., `optimizeDeps`, `ssr.noExternal`, `rollupOptions.external`) to see if they affect compatibility.
  - Verifying compatibility between package versions and the Node.js environment/build setup.
- Implement fixes for any identified compatibility issues. This could involve:
  - Updating packages to compatible versions.
  - Adjusting Vite configuration.
  - Using dynamic imports or other code modifications if necessary (as a last resort).
- Ensure the fixes do not introduce regressions in other parts of the application.

## Constraints

- The primary focus is on resolving runtime errors and compatibility issues with the specified packages.
- Aim for solutions that integrate well with the existing Vite build setup.

## Success Criteria

- Running `npm run build` completes without errors.
- Running `npm start -- generate -- --generators ai-magic` (and potentially other commands that use the investigated packages) executes without encountering runtime errors related to module compatibility with `ora`, `inquirer`, or `langchain`.
- Features relying on these packages function as expected.

## Related Documentation

- `memory-bank/TechnicalArchitecture.md` (for information on `ProgressIndicator`, CLI structure, LLM interaction, and build setup)
- `package.json` (for package versions)
- `vite.config.ts` (for build configuration)
- `src/core/ui/progress-indicator.ts` (for `ora` usage)
- `src/core/cli/cli-interface.ts` (for `inquirer` usage)
- `src/core/llm/` directory (for `langchain` usage)

## Timeline

- This task is critical as it affects core CLI functionality.

## Memory Bank Updates

- Document the identified compatibility issues and the implemented fixes in `memory-bank/TechnicalArchitecture.md` or `memory-bank/DeveloperGuide.md` as appropriate.
