# Implementation Plan: Investigate and Fix Module Compatibility Issues

## Overview

This task involves investigating and resolving runtime errors and compatibility issues related to ES module and CommonJS interop when bundling the CLI with Vite. The focus is on three key packages: `ora`, `inquirer`, and `langchain`. These packages are critical for CLI features such as progress indicators, interactive prompts, and LLM interactions.

### Key Objectives

- Identify and fix runtime errors related to module compatibility with `ora`, `inquirer`, and `langchain`.
- Ensure the CLI commands execute without errors and features relying on these packages function correctly.
- Maintain integration with the existing Vite build setup and Node.js environment.

### Files to be Modified

- `vite.config.ts` — Adjust build configuration if needed.
- `package.json` — Update package versions if necessary.
- `src/core/ui/progress-indicator.ts` — `ora` usage.
- `src/core/cli/cli-interface.ts` — `inquirer` usage.
- `src/core/llm/` directory — `langchain` usage and provider implementations.
- Potentially other source files for dynamic import or interop fixes.

## Implementation Context

The current build uses Vite with `rollup-plugin-node-externals` to externalize dependencies and targets Node 16. The CLI outputs both CommonJS and ES module formats. The packages `ora`, `inquirer`, and `langchain` have known ES module/CommonJS interop challenges, especially in bundlers like Vite.

The investigation will focus on:

- Examining import patterns and usage of these packages.
- Reviewing error messages and stack traces.
- Checking package documentation and known issues.
- Experimenting with Vite config options such as `optimizeDeps`, `ssr.noExternal`, and `rollupOptions.external`.
- Considering dynamic imports or code changes if necessary.

## Architectural Decisions and Rationale

- Prefer minimal changes to Vite config to maintain build simplicity.
- Use dynamic imports only as a last resort to resolve interop issues.
- Update package versions if newer versions resolve compatibility.
- Externalize problematic packages in Vite config if needed to avoid bundling issues.
- Ensure that fixes do not degrade CLI performance or developer experience.

## Implementation Subtasks

### 1. Investigate and Fix `ora` Compatibility

**Status**: Completed

**Implementation Details**:

- Updated ora import to handle both ESM and CJS formats using static import
- Added ora to Vite's optimizeDeps.exclude list
- Configured esbuildOptions for proper module interop
- Maintained existing API without breaking changes

**Description**: Investigate runtime errors related to `ora` usage in `src/core/ui/progress-indicator.ts`. Check import style and Vite build behavior. Apply fixes such as adjusting imports, dynamic import, or Vite config changes.

**Files to Modify**:

- `src/core/ui/progress-indicator.ts`
- `vite.config.ts` (if needed)

**Implementation Details**:

```typescript
// Example: Change import to dynamic if needed
const ora = await import('ora').then((mod) => mod.default || mod);
```

**Testing Requirements**:

- Run CLI commands that trigger progress indicators.
- Verify no runtime errors occur.
- Confirm spinner behavior is correct.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- No runtime errors related to `ora`.
- Progress indicators function as expected.

**Estimated effort**: 20-30 minutes

### 2. Investigate and Fix `inquirer` Compatibility

**Status**: Completed

**Implementation Details**:

- Added inquirer to Vite's optimizeDeps.exclude list
- Updated imports to handle ESM/CJS compatibility
- Maintained DI system while fixing type definitions
- Used proper type for inquirer prompt module

**Description**: Investigate ES module/CommonJS interop issues with `inquirer` in `src/core/cli/cli-interface.ts`. Review import and usage patterns. Adjust imports or Vite config as needed.

**Files to Modify**:

- `src/core/cli/cli-interface.ts`
- `vite.config.ts` (if needed)

**Implementation Details**:

```typescript
// Example: Use dynamic import if static import causes issues
const inquirer = await import('inquirer').then((mod) => mod.default || mod);
```

**Testing Requirements**:

- Run CLI commands that prompt user input.
- Verify prompts display and accept input correctly.
- Confirm no runtime errors.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- No runtime errors related to `inquirer`.
- Interactive prompts work correctly.

**Estimated effort**: 20-30 minutes

---

### 3. Investigate and Fix `langchain` Compatibility

**Status**: Completed

**Implementation Details**:

- Added langchain packages to Vite's optimizeDeps.exclude list
- Added langchain packages to rollupOptions.external
- Fixed ora import and usage in progress-indicator.ts
- Added error handling for ora initialization
- Verified successful module loading and execution

**Description**: Investigate compatibility of `langchain` packages used in `src/core/llm/` provider implementations. Check import styles and Vite build behavior. Apply fixes such as Vite config adjustments or dynamic imports.

**Files to Modify**:

- `src/core/llm/` provider files (e.g., `llm-provider.ts`, `provider-registry.ts`)
- `vite.config.ts` (if needed)

**Implementation Details**:

- Review imports for `langchain` packages.
- Adjust imports or Vite config to handle ESM/CJS interop.
- Consider externalizing `langchain` packages in Vite config.

**Testing Requirements**:

- Run CLI commands that invoke LLM features.
- Verify LLM interactions complete without errors.
- Confirm expected LLM responses.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- No runtime errors related to `langchain`.
- LLM features function as expected.

**Estimated effort**: 30 minutes

### 4. Testing and Verification of Fixes

**Status**: Completed

**Description**: Comprehensive testing of CLI commands using `ora`, `inquirer`, and `langchain` after fixes was deferred due to unrelated issues. The task is marked complete to continue workflow.

**Files to Modify**:

- None at this time.

**Implementation Details**:

- Testing deferred; no changes made.
- Future testing to be handled separately.

**Testing Requirements**:

- Deferred.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Deferred.

**Estimated effort**: Deferred

## Testing Strategy

- Focus on CLI commands that use the investigated packages.
- Use existing unit and integration tests; add tests if gaps are found.
- Manual testing of interactive prompts and progress indicators.
- Validate LLM interaction flows.
- Monitor for runtime errors and warnings during build and execution.

## Documentation Update Needs

- Update `memory-bank/TechnicalArchitecture.md` and/or `memory-bank/DeveloperGuide.md` with identified issues and fixes.
