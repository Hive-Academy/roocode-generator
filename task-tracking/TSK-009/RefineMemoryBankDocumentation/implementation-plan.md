# Implementation Plan: TSK-009/RefineMemoryBankDocumentation

## Overview

This plan outlines the steps to refine the core memory bank documentation files (`ProjectOverview.md`, `TechnicalArchitecture.md`, `DeveloperGuide.md`) to improve formatting, consistency, accuracy, and structure, addressing specific issues identified during analysis.

See `task-tracking/TSK-009/RefineMemoryBankDocumentation/task-description.md#2-requirements` for detailed requirements and `task-tracking/TSK-009/RefineMemoryBankDocumentation/task-description.md#3-acceptance-criteria` for the full list of acceptance criteria.

## Implementation Strategy

### Approach

The refinement will be performed file by file, addressing both global requirements (metadata, links, standard text updates) and file-specific requirements within each document. This allows for focused editing and review of each file. The `DeveloperGuide.md` requires the most significant refactoring and will be handled last.

### Key Components

- **Affected Areas**:
  - `memory-bank/ProjectOverview.md`
  - `memory-bank/TechnicalArchitecture.md`
  - `memory-bank/DeveloperGuide.md`
- **Dependencies**:
  - `package.json` (for current version `1.0.1` and repository URL `https://github.com/Hive-Academy/roocode-generator.git`)
  - Current date (for `lastUpdated` metadata)
- **Risk Areas**:
  - Manual editing errors, particularly in link conversion and metadata updates.
  - Ensuring logical restructuring and correct sequential numbering in `DeveloperGuide.md`.
  - Accurately fixing duplicated line numbers in `DeveloperGuide.md` code blocks.
  - Ensuring all internal links resolve correctly after conversion.

## Implementation Subtasks

### 1. Refine `ProjectOverview.md`

**Status**: Completed

**Description**: Apply global refinements and specific fixes to `ProjectOverview.md`.

**Files to Modify**:

- `memory-bank/ProjectOverview.md`

**Implementation Details**:

- Update YAML frontmatter: set `version` to `1.0.1`, set `lastUpdated` to the completion date (YYYY-MM-DD).
- Replace placeholder repository URL with `https://github.com/Hive-Academy/roocode-generator.git`.
- Find mentions of the test co-location plan and update text to state it's abandoned.
- Convert all `[[Link]]` or `[[Link#Section]]` formats to relative Markdown links (`./Filename.md` or `./Filename.md#section-slug`). Generate slugs correctly (lowercase, hyphenated).
- Remove the outer ` ```markdown ... ``` ` wrapper.
- Review and clarify the description of the `memory-bank/` directory (around original line 82).

**Testing Requirements**:

- Manual review: Verify YAML updates, URL replacement, link format/validity, removal of code block wrapper, clarity of directory description, and update to test plan mention.

**Related Acceptance Criteria**:

- AC1, AC2 (partially), AC3 (partially), AC4 (partially), AC5 (partially), AC6 (partially), AC7, AC14 (partially)

**Estimated effort**: 15 minutes

**Delegation Notes**: Suitable for direct implementation by Senior Developer. No delegation was performed.
**Acceptance Criteria Verification**: All related ACs (AC1, AC2 partial, AC3 partial, AC4 partial, AC5 partial, AC6 partial, AC7, AC14 partial) were manually verified and satisfied.

### 2. Refine `TechnicalArchitecture.md`

**Status**: Completed

**Description**: Apply global refinements and specific fixes to `TechnicalArchitecture.md`.

**Files to Modify**:

- `memory-bank/TechnicalArchitecture.md`

**Implementation Details**:

- Update YAML frontmatter: set `version` to `1.0.1`, set `lastUpdated` to the completion date (YYYY-MM-DD).
- Replace placeholder repository URL with `https://github.com/Hive-Academy/roocode-generator.git`.
- Find mentions of the test co-location plan and update text to state it's abandoned.
- Convert all `[[Link]]` or `[[Link#Section]]` formats to relative Markdown links (`./Filename.md` or `./Filename.md#section-slug`). Generate slugs correctly.
- Remove the redundant inline metadata block (original lines 11-14).
- Consolidate the duplicated description of `@core/application` (original lines 99-103 and 107-111).
- Briefly review component descriptions and data flow for obvious inaccuracies (best effort).

**Testing Requirements**:

- Manual review: Verify YAML updates, URL replacement, link format/validity, removal of inline metadata, consolidation of duplicated text, and update to test plan mention.

**Related Acceptance Criteria**:

- AC2 (partially), AC3 (partially), AC4 (partially), AC5 (partially), AC6 (partially), AC8, AC9, AC14 (partially)

**Estimated effort**: 20 minutes

**Delegation Notes**: Suitable for direct implementation by Senior Developer. No delegation was performed.
**Acceptance Criteria Verification**: All related ACs (AC2 partial, AC3 partial, AC4 partial, AC5 partial - N/A, AC6 partial, AC8, AC9, AC14 partial) were manually verified and satisfied. The repository URL replacement (AC5) was not applicable as no placeholder was found in this file.

### 3. Refine `DeveloperGuide.md`

**Status**: Completed (User Override)

**Description**: Apply global refinements and perform major structural and content fixes on `DeveloperGuide.md`.

**Files to Modify**:

- `memory-bank/DeveloperGuide.md`

**Implementation Details**:

- Update YAML frontmatter: set `version` to `1.0.1`, set `lastUpdated` to the completion date (YYYY-MM-DD).
- Replace placeholder repository URL with `https://github.com/Hive-Academy/roocode-generator.git`.
- Find mentions of the test co-location plan and update text to state it's abandoned.
- Convert all `[[Link]]` or `[[Link#Section]]` formats to relative Markdown links (`./Filename.md` or `./Filename.md#section-slug`). Generate slugs correctly.
- **Major Refactor**: Re-structure sections logically, ensuring sequential numbering (e.g., `## 1.`, `### 1.1.`, `## 2.`) and consistent heading levels.
- **Major Fix**: Identify and correct all duplicated line numbers within code blocks/examples. Ensure line numbers are sequential within each block.
- Remove the broken link to `CHANGELOG.md` (original line 508).
- Review Section 2 (Project Structure) and 2.1 (Command Execution Flow) for overlap with `TechnicalArchitecture.md`. Condense content and add relative links to relevant sections in `./TechnicalArchitecture.md`.

**Testing Requirements**:

- Manual review: Verify YAML updates, URL replacement, link format/validity, removal of broken link, update to test plan mention.
- **Detailed Manual Review**: Carefully check the new section structure, numbering, and heading consistency.
- **Detailed Manual Review**: Verify that all code block line numbers are corrected and sequential within their blocks.
- Manual review: Confirm content overlap is reduced and references to `TechnicalArchitecture.md` are added correctly.

**Related Acceptance Criteria**:

- AC2 (fully), AC3 (fully), AC4 (fully), AC5 (fully), AC6 (fully), AC10, AC11, AC12, AC13, AC14 (fully)

**Estimated effort**: 30-45 minutes

**Delegation Notes**: Suitable for direct implementation by Senior Developer due to the complexity of refactoring and line number correction. No delegation was performed.
**Redelegation History**: Redelegated once due to AC11 (line numbers) not being met. Second attempt resulted in formatting issues (AC11, AC14).
**Acceptance Criteria Verification**: User accepted the final state despite identified formatting issues in code blocks (affecting AC11 and AC14). Other ACs (AC2, AC3, AC4, AC5, AC6, AC10, AC12, AC13) were verified as satisfied based on the content changes.

## Implementation Sequence

1.  **Subtask 1: Refine `ProjectOverview.md`** - Establishes baseline edits and addresses file-specific issues.
2.  **Subtask 2: Refine `TechnicalArchitecture.md`** - Continues baseline edits and addresses its specific issues.
3.  **Subtask 3: Refine `DeveloperGuide.md`** - Addresses the most complex refactoring and remaining global edits.
