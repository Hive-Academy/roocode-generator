# Task Description: Refine Memory Bank Documentation

**Task ID:** TSK-009
**Task Name:** Refine Memory Bank Documentation
**Status:** In Progress
**Assigned To:** Architect
**Date Created:** 2025-05-02

## 1. Overview

The core memory bank documentation files (`ProjectOverview.md`, `TechnicalArchitecture.md`, `DeveloperGuide.md`) require refinement to improve formatting, consistency, accuracy, and structure. This task involves addressing specific issues identified during analysis.

**Affected Files:**

- `memory-bank/ProjectOverview.md`
- `memory-bank/TechnicalArchitecture.md`
- `memory-bank/DeveloperGuide.md`

## 2. Requirements

### 2.1. Global Refinements (Apply to all affected files where applicable)

1.  **Internal Links:** Standardize all internal links from the `[[Filename]]` or `[[Filename#Section]]` format to standard relative Markdown links (e.g., `./TechnicalArchitecture.md` or `./TechnicalArchitecture.md#section-slug`). Ensure section slugs are correctly generated (lowercase, hyphenated).
2.  **Version Metadata:** Verify and update the `version` field in the YAML frontmatter of all three files to match the current project version (`1.0.1` as per `package.json`).
3.  **Timestamp Metadata:** Update the `lastUpdated` field in the YAML frontmatter of all three files to the date when these refinements are completed. Use `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
4.  **Repository URL:** Replace the placeholder repository URL (`https://github.com/yourusername/roocode-generator.git`) with the correct URL: `https://github.com/Hive-Academy/roocode-generator.git`.
5.  **Test Co-location Plan:** Update all mentions of the plan to co-locate test files. Clearly state that this plan has been **abandoned** and the current structure (`tests/` directory) will be maintained.

### 2.2. `ProjectOverview.md` Specific Refinements

1.  **Formatting:** Remove the outer markdown code block wrapper (` ```markdown ... ``` `) surrounding the entire file content.
2.  **Clarity:** Review and clarify the description of the `memory-bank/` directory (around original line 82) to avoid confusion, as the file itself resides there.

### 2.3. `TechnicalArchitecture.md` Specific Refinements

1.  **Metadata:** Remove the redundant inline metadata block (original lines 11-14). Rely solely on the YAML frontmatter.
2.  **Content Duplication:** Consolidate the duplicated description of the `@core/application` component (original lines 99-103 and 107-111) into a single, accurate description.
3.  **Accuracy Review (Best Effort):** Briefly review component descriptions and the data flow diagram/description (Section 5.3) for general accuracy against the current codebase state. Note any significant discrepancies found during refinement, but deep analysis is not required for this task.

### 2.4. `DeveloperGuide.md` Specific Refinements

1.  **Structure & Numbering:** **Major Refactor:** Re-structure and re-number all sections logically and sequentially, starting from Section 1. Ensure a consistent heading hierarchy (e.g., `## 1. Section`, `### 1.1. Subsection`).
2.  **Duplicated Line Numbers:** **Major Fix:** Identify and correct all instances of duplicated line numbers within code blocks and examples throughout the document. Ensure line numbers are sequential and accurate within their respective blocks.
3.  **Broken Link:** Remove the broken link to `CHANGELOG.md` (original line 508), as the file does not exist.
4.  **Content Overlap:** Review Section 2 (Project Structure) and 2.1 (Command Execution Flow) for significant overlap with `TechnicalArchitecture.md`. Condense the information in `DeveloperGuide.md` and add references to the relevant sections in `TechnicalArchitecture.md` where appropriate.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

The task is complete when all the following criteria are met:

- [ ] **AC1:** `ProjectOverview.md` no longer contains the outer markdown code block wrapper.
- [ ] **AC2:** All internal links in the three files use relative Markdown format (`./Filename.md` or `./Filename.md#section-slug`) and point to valid targets.
- [ ] **AC3:** The `version` in the YAML frontmatter of all three files is `1.0.1`.
- [ ] **AC4:** The `lastUpdated` date in the YAML frontmatter of all three files reflects the date of completion (in `YYYY-MM-DD` format).
- [ ] **AC5:** The repository URL `https://github.com/Hive-Academy/roocode-generator.git` is correctly used in all three files, replacing the placeholder.
- [ ] **AC6:** All mentions of the test co-location plan clearly state it has been abandoned.
- [ ] **AC7:** The description of the `memory-bank/` directory in `ProjectOverview.md` is clarified.
- [ ] **AC8:** The redundant inline metadata block is removed from `TechnicalArchitecture.md`.
- [ ] **AC9:** The duplicated description of `@core/application` in `TechnicalArchitecture.md` is consolidated.
- [ ] **AC10:** Sections in `DeveloperGuide.md` are logically structured and sequentially numbered with correct heading levels.
- [ ] **AC11:** All duplicated line numbers within code blocks/examples in `DeveloperGuide.md` are corrected and sequential within their blocks.
- [ ] **AC12:** The broken link to `CHANGELOG.md` in `DeveloperGuide.md` is removed.
- [ ] **AC13:** Content overlap regarding project structure/command flow between `DeveloperGuide.md` and `TechnicalArchitecture.md` is reduced through referencing.
- [ ] **AC14:** All three files are well-formatted, valid Markdown.

## 4. Implementation Guidance

- Focus on addressing the specific points listed in the requirements.
- Use standard Markdown formatting.
- For section slugs in links, use lowercase letters and hyphens for spaces (e.g., `#section-slug`).
- Verify changes carefully, especially the structural refactor of `DeveloperGuide.md`.

## 5. Memory Bank References

- `memory-bank/ProjectOverview.md` (Current state)
- `memory-bank/TechnicalArchitecture.md` (Current state)
- `memory-bank/DeveloperGuide.md` (Current state)
- `package.json` (for version and repository URL)
