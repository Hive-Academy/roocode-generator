# Completion Report: TSK-009/RefineMemoryBankDocumentation

## Task Summary

Refined the core memory bank documentation files (`ProjectOverview.md`, `TechnicalArchitecture.md`, `DeveloperGuide.md`) to improve formatting, consistency, accuracy, and structure, addressing specific issues identified during analysis. See [../task-description.md](./task-description.md) for original requirements.

### Implementation Details

- **Completed**: 2025-05-02
- **Developer**: Senior Developer (via Architect)
- **Reviewer**: Code Review (via Architect)

## Implementation Summary

### Changes Made

- Updated YAML metadata (version `1.0.1`, lastUpdated `2025-05-02`) across all three files.
- Standardized internal links to relative Markdown format (e.g., `./TechnicalArchitecture.md#section-slug`).
- Corrected repository URL placeholder to `https://github.com/Hive-Academy/roocode-generator.git`.
- Clarified abandoned test co-location plan status in all relevant sections.
- Removed outer markdown wrapper from `ProjectOverview.md`.
- Removed redundant inline metadata and consolidated duplicated text (`@core/application`) in `TechnicalArchitecture.md`.
- Performed major structural refactoring, renumbering, and content condensation in `DeveloperGuide.md`.
- Removed broken `CHANGELOG.md` link from `DeveloperGuide.md`.
- Addressed code block line numbering issues in `DeveloperGuide.md` (final state accepted by user).

### Components Modified

See [../../../memory-bank/TechnicalArchitecture.md#core-components](../../../memory-bank/TechnicalArchitecture.md#core-components) for component details.

- `memory-bank/ProjectOverview.md`
- `memory-bank/TechnicalArchitecture.md`
- `memory-bank/DeveloperGuide.md`

### Technical Decisions

N/A (Primarily editing and restructuring based on analysis and task requirements).

## Verification

### Requirements Check

All 14 Acceptance Criteria defined in [../task-description.md](./task-description.md) were verified and met. AC11 and AC14 (related to `DeveloperGuide.md` code block formatting/numbering) were acknowledged as partially met per user acceptance. See [../code-review.md](./code-review.md) for detailed verification.

### Testing Completed

- **Unit Tests**: N/A (Documentation task)
- **Integration Tests**: N/A (Documentation task)
- **Coverage**: N/A (Documentation task)

### Quality Checks

- **Code Review**: APPROVED WITH RESERVATIONS (See [../code-review.md](./code-review.md)). Reservations relate to minor formatting/numbering issues in `DeveloperGuide.md` code blocks (AC11/AC14).
- **Standards**: Adhered to Markdown standards.
- **Documentation**: Completed. The core memory bank files themselves were updated as the primary output of this task.

## Follow-up

### Known Issues

Minor formatting/numbering issues persist in some code blocks within `memory-bank/DeveloperGuide.md` (related to AC11/AC14), accepted in the current state but noted for future improvement.

### Future Improvements

- **Recommendation:** Create a follow-up task (e.g., TSK-010) to specifically address the remaining code block formatting issues in `memory-bank/DeveloperGuide.md`.
- **Recommendation:** Create follow-up tasks to update `README.md` based on the refined memory bank content and to generate/update `CHANGELOG.md` based on the `task-tracking/` directory, as discussed earlier.

### Dependencies Updated

None.
