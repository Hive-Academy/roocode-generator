# Completion Report: Implement CLI Bootstrap and Update Vite Config

## Task Summary

Implemented a dedicated bootstrap file (`cli-main.ts`) for the CLI to ensure proper execution flow after bundling, and updated the Vite configuration (`vite.config.ts`) to use this new file as the build entry point. This addresses the issue where the bundled CLI code was present but not automatically executed.

### Implementation Details

- **Completed**: 4/29/2025
- **Developer**: Architect (delegated)
- **Reviewer**: Code Review (delegated)

## Implementation Summary

### Changes Made

- Created `src/core/cli/cli-main.ts` to serve as the primary entry point for the bundled CLI, containing the logic to instantiate and run the `CliInterface`.
- Modified `vite.config.ts` to change the `build.lib.entry` path to the new `cli-main.ts` file.
- Ensured the new entry point correctly imports necessary modules and handles basic command parsing and placeholder output.

### Components Modified

- `src/core/cli/cli-main.ts` (New file)
- `vite.config.ts` (Modified)

### Technical Decisions

- Decided to create a separate bootstrap file (`cli-main.ts`) to clearly separate CLI definition from execution logic, improving maintainability and build configuration clarity.
- Configured Vite to bundle this new bootstrap file as the main entry point for the CLI library build.

## Verification

### Requirements Check

- [x] Create a new file `src/core/cli/cli-main.ts`.
- [x] This file should import `CliInterface` and `createPromptModule`.
- [x] It should contain an asynchronous `main` function with instantiation and parsing logic.
- [x] The `main` function should be called at the end of the file, with error handling.
- [x] Update `vite.config.ts` to change the `build.lib.entry` path to `src/core/cli/cli-main.ts`.
- [x] Ensure the existing build configuration remains compatible.
- [x] Running `npm run build` completes without errors.
- [x] Running `npm start -- generate -- --generators ai-magic` executes the code in `cli-main.ts` and prints placeholder output.

### Testing Completed

- **Unit Tests**: N/A (Focus was on integration of build and execution flow)
- **Integration Tests**: Manual testing performed to verify build success and CLI execution with command parsing.
- **Coverage**: N/A

### Quality Checks

- **Code Review**: Completed with reservations (related to the `ora` error).
- **Standards**: Code adheres to project standards.
- **Documentation**: Memory bank updates planned.

## Follow-up

### Known Issues

- A runtime error related to the `ora` package occurs during execution, preventing full CLI functionality beyond the initial bootstrap. This needs to be investigated and fixed in a separate task.

### Future Improvements

- Add automated integration tests for the bundled CLI execution flow to prevent regressions.
- Implement the actual generator and config command logic within `cli-main.ts` (this was outside the scope of this fix).

### Dependencies Updated

- None directly related to this fix.
