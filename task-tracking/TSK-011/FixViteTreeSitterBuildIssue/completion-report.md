# Completion Report: TSK-011 - FixViteTreeSitterBuildIssue

**Task ID:** TSK-011
**Status:** Completed

## 1. Summary

This task successfully resolved the high-priority build configuration issue preventing Tree-sitter native modules (`.node` files) from loading correctly in the Vite-built application. The fix involved modifying the build process in `package.json` to ensure necessary files are copied to the correct location within the `dist` directory, unblocking TSK-008.

## 2. Implementation Details

- **Strategy:** Implemented the "Externalization + Post-build Copy" approach.
- **Dependencies:** Added `cpy-cli` as a development dependency.
- **Build Scripts (`package.json`):**
  - Added a `postbuild` script using `cpy-cli` to copy `node_modules/tree-sitter-*/bindings/node/*.node` and `node_modules/node-tree-sitter/binding.gyp` into the `dist/bin/node_modules/...` structure.
  - Modified the main `build` script to execute the `postbuild` script after `vite build`.
- **Configuration Files:** Changes were confined to `package.json`. No modifications were needed in `vite.config.ts` or `src/` files.

## 3. Verification

- **Build:** The `npm run build` command completes successfully.
- **Runtime:** The built application (`node dist/bin/roocode-generator.js ...`) no longer throws the "Invalid language object" error when loading Tree-sitter grammars.
- **File Structure:** Native `.node` files and `binding.gyp` are correctly located within the `dist/bin/node_modules/` subdirectories post-build.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria Validation

| Criterion | Status       | Verification Notes                                                                                               |
| :-------- | :----------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AC1**   | ✅ SATISFIED | `npm run build` completes successfully, including the `postbuild` step.                                          |
| **AC2**   | ✅ SATISFIED | Runtime error "Invalid language object" is confirmed resolved when running the built application.                |
| **AC3**   | ✅ SATISFIED | Grammar loading confirmed successful in the built app via temporary logging during verification.                 |
| **AC4**   | ✅ SATISFIED | `.node` files and `binding.gyp` confirmed present in the correct relative paths within `dist/bin/node_modules/`. |
| **AC5**   | ✅ SATISFIED | Changes were limited to `package.json`, avoiding modifications to `src/` code.                                   |
| **AC6**   | ✅ SATISFIED | The blocker for TSK-008's manual verification steps is resolved based on AC2/AC3.                                |

## 5. Memory Bank Updates

- No updates to memory bank files were required for this task, as it was a build configuration fix. However, the solution pattern (using `postbuild` script with `cpy-cli` for native addons in Vite builds) could be documented in `DeveloperGuide.md` or `TechnicalArchitecture.md` in the future if this pattern becomes common.

## 6. Follow-up Items

- None directly from this task. The next step is to resume the blocked task, TSK-008.
