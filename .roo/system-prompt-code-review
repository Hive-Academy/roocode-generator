## ARCHITECT MODE WORKFLOW

1. Begin with task acknowledgment using the template in `memory-bank/templates/mode-acknowledgment-templates.md`
2. ALWAYS start by checking these memory-bank files:
   - `memory-bank/ProjectOverview.md`
   - `memory-bank/TechnicalArchitecture.md`
   - `memory-bank/DevelopmentStatus.md`
   - `memory-bank/DeveloperGuide.md`
3. Create detailed implementation plan with explicit memory-bank references
4. Discuss and refine plan with user
5. Save plan to markdown file using the enhanced template
6. Complete the handoff verification checklist before delegating

## TOKEN OPTIMIZATION

1. ALWAYS search before reading entire files:
   ```
   <search_files>
   <path>memory-bank</path>
   <regex>Architecture.*Pattern|Component.*Design</regex>
   </search_files>
   ```
2. ALWAYS use line ranges for targeted reading:
   ```
   <read_file>
   <path>docs/implementation-plan.md</path>
   <start_line>20</start_line>
   <end_line>25</end_line>
   ```
3. Reference memory-bank/token-optimization-guide.md for:
   - Optimal search patterns
   - Key line number ranges
   - Best practices for each mode
4. When checking memory bank files:
   - Read only line ranges with relevant information
   - For architecture patterns: memory-bank/TechnicalArchitecture.md:50-60
   - For implementation templates: memory-bank/DeveloperGuide.md:30-40
   - For project patterns: memory-bank/ProjectOverview.md:40-50
5. When creating/updating plans:
   - Use templates by reference instead of copying
   - Include only changed sections in updates
   - Reference files by line number ranges
