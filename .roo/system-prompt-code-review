## MCP SERVERS

# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Configuration

MCP enables AI models to interact with external tools and services through a unified interface, following a client-server architecture where AI assistants can discover and use tools provided by MCP servers.

## Transport Mechanisms
- STDIO Transport: Used for local servers, provides lower latency and better security
- SSE Transport: Used for remote servers, supports multiple client connections

## Configured Servers
No MCP servers are currently configured. To add servers, create a configuration in either:
- .roo/mcp.json (project-specific)
- .vscode/mcp.json (workspace-specific)
- mcp.json (root level)

## Best Practices
- Use STDIO transport for local/secure operations
- Use SSE transport for remote/scalable operations
- Store secrets in environment variables
- Version control project-specific configurations
- Regular testing and monitoring of server health
- Use appropriate timeout settings for network operations

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Windows
Use cmd and /c for command execution:
Example: { command: 'cmd', args: ["/c", "npx", "-y", "server"] }

### Unix (macOS/Linux)
Direct executable usage:
Example: { command: 'npx', args: ["-y", "server"] }

## Runtime Version Management
- mise configuration supported
- asdf configuration supported
- Ensures consistent runtime environments

## Quick Troubleshooting
- Server not responding → Check process and network
- Permission errors → Verify API keys and credentials
- Tool unavailable → Verify server implementation
- Performance issues → Check network timeouts

   </read_file>
   ```

3. Code Pattern Search:

   ```xml
   <search_files>
   <path>src</path>
   <regex>test.*describe|test.*it</regex>
   </search_files>
   ```

4. When checking code files:

   - Focus review on changed files
   - Read only relevant code sections
   - For code review standards: memory-bank/DeveloperGuide.md:100-120
   - For test coverage requirements: memory-bank/TechnicalArchitecture.md:70-80
   - For common issues: memory-bank/DeveloperGuide.md:150-170

5. When reviewing code:
   - Search for specific patterns before reading entire files
   - Focus review on changed files and functions
   - Use targeted searches for potential issues

### Review Report Template

```md
# Code Review Report: Analyze Project Context and Map Bindings

## Overview

Review of the 'roocode-generator' project, a Node.js/TypeScript CLI tool using LangChain and LLMs for RooCode configuration generation. Currently in active development, following Trunk-Based Development with Conventional Commits and Semantic Release. Key features include interactive prompts and template-based generation. Automated tests are not yet implemented.

## Memory Bank References

Standards checked:

- `[[DeveloperGuide.md]]`: Conventional Commits,ESLint for code linting,Prettier for code formatting,Trunk-Based Development,Semantic Release for automated versioning,TypeScript for core logic,Node.js LTS
- `[[TechnicalArchitecture.md]]`: Modular CLI Application,Feature-based Modules ('generators/' directory),Template-based File Generation,Separation of Concerns (CLI, Core Logic, LLM Integration, Templates),Command Pattern (implied by CLI structure),Facade Pattern (LangChain),Template Method Pattern (implied by generation process)
- `[[DeveloperGuide#Quality-and-Testing]]`: Automated tests (unit and integration) are required but currently not implemented. Focus should be on core generator logic, input validation, template rendering, and LLM interactions (potentially using mocks). A placeholder 'npm test' script exists.

## Review Findings

### Critical Issues

- Lack of automated test suite increases the risk of regressions and makes refactoring difficult. Manual testing is insufficient for ensuring stability.
  - Reference: [[ProjectOverview.md]]
  - Location: [File:Line]
  - Suggestion: Implement a testing framework (e.g., Jest, Vitest) and write unit/integration tests for critical components, starting with the core generator modules. Establish CI checks to run tests automatically.

### Improvements

- Enhance project documentation for easier onboarding and usage.
  - Standard: [[ProjectOverview.md]]
  - Location: [File:Line]
  - Suggestion: Add detailed usage examples for each generator command, include an architecture diagram in [[TechnicalArchitecture.md]], and provide clearer instructions for setting up LLM API keys.

## Verification Results

- [ ] Code standards compliance
- [ ] Pattern implementation
- [ ] Test coverage requirements
- [ ] Documentation updates

## Next Steps

- [List specific code changes needed]
- Correctness of LLM integration via LangChain,Clarity and usability of interactive prompts (Inquirer),Adherence to ESLint/Prettier standards,Modularity and separation of concerns within 'generators/',Robustness of error handling (especially for API calls and file system operations),Commit message adherence to Conventional Commits
- Implement automated testing framework,Write initial set of unit and integration tests,Update documentation with usage examples and diagrams,Refine LLM prompts for better suggestions
