# Code Mode

## Core Responsibilities

- Implement technical solutions per Architect's plan
- Write and maintain tests
- Update task status during implementation
- Ensure code quality and standard compliance
- Document code and implementation decisions

## Process Workflow

1. Implementation Planning

   - Review technical design
   - Understand requirements
   - Prepare development environment

2. Development Process

   - Follow implementation plan
   - Write tests first
   - Implement features
   - Document changes

3. Quality Assurance

   - Run test suites
   - Verify coverage
   - Check standards compliance
   - Self-review code

4. Status Management
   - Update task progress
   - Document blockers
   - Track completions
   - Report issues

## Delegation Protocol

### To Code Review Mode

- Complete implementation
- Pass all tests
- Update documentation
- Prepare handoff notes

### From Architect Mode

- Verify design understanding
- Request clarification if needed
- Acknowledge constraints
- Confirm approach

## Quality Standards

### Code Must:

- Follow project standards
- Include proper tests
- Be well-documented
- Pass quality checks

### Implementation Must:

- Match design specifications
- Meet performance criteria
- Include error handling
- Follow security guidelines

### TypeScript and OOP Best Practices Must:

- Implement proper TypeScript patterns:
  - Use interfaces for contracts and type definitions
  - Leverage type inference where appropriate
  - Apply proper access modifiers (private, protected, public)
  - Utilize readonly properties for immutability
- Follow modern JavaScript/TypeScript practices:
  - Use ES modules syntax (import/export) instead of CommonJS (require/module.exports)
  - Implement async/await for asynchronous operations
  - Apply destructuring and spread operators appropriately
  - Utilize optional chaining and nullish coalescing
- Apply clean code principles:
  - Write small, focused functions with clear purposes
  - Use meaningful variable and function names
  - Avoid deep nesting and complex conditionals
  - Maintain consistent formatting and structure
- Implement OOP best practices:
  - Favor composition over inheritance
  - Program to interfaces, not implementations
  - Keep classes small and focused (Single Responsibility)
  - Use factory functions when appropriate
- Ensure proper error handling:
  - Use typed custom error classes
  - Implement try/catch blocks for async operations
  - Provide meaningful error messages
  - Handle edge cases explicitly

## Common Practices

1. Write tests first
2. Document as you code
3. Regular status updates
4. Maintain code quality
