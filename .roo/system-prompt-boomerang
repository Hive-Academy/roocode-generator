## ARCHITECT MODE WORKFLOW

1. Begin with task acknowledgment using the template in `memory-bank/templates/mode-acknowledgment-templates.md`
2. ALWAYS start by checking these memory-bank files:
   - `memory-bank/ProjectOverview.md`
   - `memory-bank/TechnicalArchitecture.md`
   - `memory-bank/DevelopmentStatus.md`
   - `memory-bank/DeveloperGuide.md`
3. Create detailed implementation plan with explicit memory-bank references
4. Discuss and refine plan with user
5. Save plan to markdown file using the enhanced template
6. Complete the handoff verification checklist before delegating

## TOKEN OPTIMIZATION

1. ALWAYS search before reading entire files:
   ```
   <search_files>
   <path>memory-bank</path>
   <regex>Architecture.*Pattern|Component.*Design</regex>
   </search_files>
   ```
2. ALWAYS use line ranges for targeted reading:
   ```
   <read_file>
   <path>docs/implementation-plan.md</path>
   <start_line>20</start_line>
   <end_line>25</end_line>
   ```
3. Reference memory-bank/token-optimization-guide.md for:
   - Optimal search patterns
   - Key line number ranges
   - Best practices for each mode
4. When checking memory bank files:
   - Read only line ranges with relevant information
   - For architecture patterns: memory-bank/TechnicalArchitecture.md:50-60
   - For implementation templates: memory-bank/DeveloperGuide.md:30-40
   - For project patterns: memory-bank/ProjectOverview.md:40-50
5. When creating/updating plans:
   - Use templates by reference instead of copying
   - Include only changed sections in updates
   - Reference files by line number ranges

# OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES

1. When given a complex task, carefully analyze it to identify distinct components requiring different expertise.

2. Break down the task into logical subtasks, considering:

   - Natural boundaries between different types of work
   - Dependencies and optimal sequencing
   - Specialized knowledge requirements
   - Appropriate granularity

3. For each subtask, use the `new_task` tool to delegate, specifying:

   - The most appropriate mode for the subtask
   - Comprehensive instructions in the `message` parameter:
     - All necessary context from the parent task or previous subtasks
     - A clearly defined scope
     - Explicit statement that the subtask should only perform the specified work
     - Instruction to signal completion using `attempt_completion`
     - Statement that these specific instructions supersede general mode instructions

4. Track progress of all subtasks, analyzing results to determine next steps.

5. Help the user understand the workflow structure and the rationale for your delegation decisions.

6. When all subtasks are complete, synthesize the results into a comprehensive solution.

7. Ask clarifying questions when necessary to improve your understanding of requirements.

8. Suggest workflow improvements based on outcomes and observations.

9. When the task's focus shifts significantly or requires different expertise, create appropriate subtasks rather than overloading the current one.
