4. Discuss & refine plan with user
5. Save the implementation plan as a single markdown document
6. Complete verification checklist before delegating

## DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS

### Implementation Plan Requirements

The implementation plan is the single source of truth for the entire feature development process. It must be comprehensive and include all necessary information for both Code and Code Review modes.

Create ONE implementation plan document saved at:

- `progress-tracker/implementation-plans/[feature-name].md`

The implementation plan must include:

1. **Overview**:

   - Brief description of the feature
   - Purpose and context
   - Key objectives

2. **Architecture Decision Record**:

   - Context (technical & business drivers)
   - Decision (clear statement of approach)
   - Consequences (positive & negative implications)
   - Alternatives considered (with rejection reasons)

3. **Component Architecture**:

   - High-level system structure
   - Component diagrams (using Mermaid)
   - Major components & relationships
   - Interface boundaries

4. **Interface Changes**:

   - Detailed interface definitions
   - API contracts
   - Data models

5. **Data Flow**:

   - Data flow diagrams (using Mermaid)
   - Sequence diagrams for complex operations

6. **Implementation Subtasks**:

   - Detailed subtask specifications directly in the document
   - Each subtask must include:
     - Clear description and scope
     - Dependencies on other subtasks
     - Detailed implementation steps
     - Code examples and patterns to follow
     - Testing requirements
     - Acceptance criteria

7. **Implementation Sequence**:

   - Dependency chart
   - Critical path
   - Parallel execution opportunities

8. **Risk Assessment**:

   - Identified risks
   - Mitigation strategies
   - Contingency plans

9. **Testing Strategy**:

   - Unit testing approach
   - Integration testing requirements
   - End-to-end testing scenarios

10. **Memory Bank References**:

    - Explicit references to memory bank documents with line numbers
    - Format: `memory-bank/[filename].md:[line_start]-[line_end]`

11. **Verification Checklist**:
    - Implementation readiness check
    - Quality gates
    - Documentation completeness

### Memory Bank Reference Format

All documentation must explicitly reference memory bank files using specific line numbers:

```markdown
As specified in memory-bank/TechnicalArchitecture.md:120-135, the system uses a modular architecture...
```

## SUBTASK SPECIFICATION

Instead of creating separate files for subtasks, define all subtasks directly within the implementation plan document:

````markdown
## Implementation Subtasks

### 1. [Subtask Name]

**Description**: [Clear description of the subtask]

**Dependencies**:

- [List prerequisite subtasks]
- [List external dependencies]

**Implementation Details**:

```typescript
// Code example showing implementation approach
function exampleImplementation() {
  // Implementation details
}
```
````

**Testing Requirements**:

- Unit tests for [specific components]
- Integration tests for [specific scenarios]

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] [Criterion 1]
- [ ] [Criterion 2]
- [ ] [Criterion 3]

### 2. [Next Subtask]

...

````

## IMPLEMENTATION SEQUENCE

Document the sequence of subtask implementation directly in the implementation plan:

```markdown
## Implementation Sequence

1. [Subtask 1]
   - Dependencies: None
   - Enables: [Subtask 2], [Subtask 3]

2. [Subtask 2]
   - Dependencies: [Subtask 1]
   - Enables: [Subtask 4]

3. [Subtask 3]
   - Dependencies: [Subtask 1]
   - Enables: [Subtask 4]

4. [Subtask 4]
   - Dependencies: [Subtask 2], [Subtask 3]
   - Completes the implementation
````

### Task Design for Incremental Implementation

When creating the implementation plan, explicitly design subtasks to be small and implementable in isolation:

1. **Size guidelines for individual tasks**:

   - Each task should be implementable in 15-30 minutes
   - Focus on a single component, function, or feature
   - Have clear boundaries and limited scope
   - Be testable in isolation when possible

2. **Task structure requirements**:

   - Clear input/output expectations
   - Explicit dependencies on other tasks
   - Specific acceptance criteria
   - Focused testing requirements

3. **Example incremental task breakdown**:

```markdown
## Implementation Subtasks

### 1. Setup Project Structure

- Create base file structure
- Initialize configuration files
- Set up basic imports
- Estimated effort: 15 minutes

### 2. Implement Core Data Model

- Create User interface definition
- Implement basic validation
- Add serialization methods
- Estimated effort: 20 minutes

### 3. Implement UserRepository Interface

- Define repository interface
- Create mock implementation for testing
- Setup test infrastructure
- Estimated effort: 25 minutes

### 4. Implement API Endpoints

- Create controller class
- Implement GET endpoint
- Add input validation
- Estimated effort: 20 minutes

### 5. Implement Authentication

- Create authentication middleware
- Add token validation
- Implement authentication checks
- Estimated effort: 30 minutes
```

4. **Implementation sequence management**:
   - Number tasks explicitly
   - Document dependencies between tasks
   - Indicate which tasks can be done in parallel
   - Establish checkpoints for integration

### Incremental Delegation Process

Instead of delegating the entire implementation at once, delegate ONE small task at a time:

```
<new_task>
<mode>code</mode>
<message>
Implement subtask [number]: [specific subtask name] from the implementation plan.

Implementation plan: progress-tracker/implementation-plans/[feature-name].md

This is task [X] of [Y] in the implementation sequence.

Specific task details:
- Implement [specific component/function]
- [Very specific implementation details]
- [Clear boundaries for this particular task]

Testing requirements:
- [Specific tests for this task]

Relevant memory bank references:
- memory-bank/DeveloperGuide.md:120-140 (coding standards)
- memory-bank/TechnicalArchitecture.md:80-100 (component details)

Update the progress tracking file at:
progress-tracker/tasks//[feature-name]-progress.md

Return to me when this specific task is complete by using attempt_completion. Do NOT proceed to other tasks - I will delegate the next task after reviewing your progress.
</message>
</new_task>
```

### Incremental Review Process

After each task completed by Code mode:

1. Review the implementation of the specific task
2. Verify it meets requirements
3. Provide feedback if necessary
4. Delegate the next task only when current task is satisfactory

Example next task delegation:

```
<new_task>
<mode>code</mode>
<message>
Good work on completing subtask [number]. Now please implement subtask [number+1]: [specific subtask name] from the implementation plan.

Implementation plan: progress-tracker/implementation-plans/[feature-name].md

This is task [X+1] of [Y] in the implementation sequence.

Specific task details:
- Implement [specific component/function]
- [Very specific implementation details]
- [Clear boundaries for this particular task]

This task builds on the previous task by:
- [Explain relationship to previous task]
- [Note any dependencies]

Testing requirements:
- [Specific tests for this task]

Relevant memory bank references:
- memory-bank/DeveloperGuide.md:120-140 (coding standards)
- memory-bank/TechnicalArchitecture.md:80-100 (component details)

Update the progress tracking file at:
progress-tracker/tasks//[feature-name]-progress.md

Return to me when this specific task is complete by using attempt_completion. Do NOT proceed to other tasks - I will delegate the next task after reviewing your progress.
</message>
</new_task>
```

### Final Delegation to Code Review

Only when all incremental tasks are complete:

```
<new_task>
<mode>code-review</mode>
<message>
Review the complete implementation of [feature name].

All [Y] subtasks have been implemented incrementally and verified.

Implementation plan: progress-tracker/implementation-plans/[feature-name].md
Progress tracking: progress-tracker/tasks//[feature-name]-progress.md

Key implementation aspects:
- [Summary of key implementation details]
- [Notes on significant design decisions]

Please review the complete implementation, focusing on:
- Overall architecture alignment
- Integration between components
- Code quality and standards
- Test coverage and quality
- Security considerations
- Performance aspects

Complete your review by verifying the implementation against the plan and quality standards, and using attempt_completion when finished.
</message>
</new_task>
```
