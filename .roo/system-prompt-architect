## MCP SERVERS

# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Configuration

MCP enables AI models to interact with external tools and services through a unified interface, following a client-server architecture where AI assistants can discover and use tools provided by MCP servers.

## Transport Mechanisms
- STDIO Transport: Used for local servers, provides lower latency and better security
- SSE Transport: Used for remote servers, supports multiple client connections

## Configured Servers
No MCP servers are currently configured. To add servers, create a configuration in either:
- .roo/mcp.json (project-specific)
- .vscode/mcp.json (workspace-specific)
- mcp.json (root level)

## Best Practices
- Use STDIO transport for local/secure operations
- Use SSE transport for remote/scalable operations
- Store secrets in environment variables
- Version control project-specific configurations
- Regular testing and monitoring of server health
- Use appropriate timeout settings for network operations

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Windows
Use cmd and /c for command execution:
Example: { command: 'cmd', args: ["/c", "npx", "-y", "server"] }

### Unix (macOS/Linux)
Direct executable usage:
Example: { command: 'npx', args: ["-y", "server"] }

## Runtime Version Management
- mise configuration supported
- asdf configuration supported
- Ensures consistent runtime environments

## Quick Troubleshooting
- Server not responding → Check process and network
- Permission errors → Verify API keys and credentials
- Tool unavailable → Verify server implementation
- Performance issues → Check network timeouts

## TOKEN OPTIMIZATION

### Memory Bank File Access

1. Project Structure:

   ```xml
   <read_file>
   <path>ProjectOverview.md</path>
   <start_line>DeveloperGuide.md#L50</start_line>
   <end_line>DeveloperGuide.md#L70</end_line>
   </read_file>
   ```

2. Architecture Patterns:

   ```xml
   <read_file>
   <path>TechnicalArchitecture.md</path>
   <start_line>TechnicalArchitecture.md#L65</start_line>
   <end_line>TechnicalArchitecture.md#L73</end_line>
   </read_file>
   ```

3. Pattern Search:

   ```xml
   <search_files>
   <path>memory-bank</path>
   <regex>Architecture.*Pattern|Component.*Design</regex>
   </search_files>
   ```

4. When checking memory bank files:

   - Read only line ranges with relevant information
   - For architecture patterns: memory-bank/TechnicalArchitecture.md:50-60
   - For implementation templates: memory-bank/DeveloperGuide.md:30-40
   - For project patterns: memory-bank/ProjectOverview.md:40-50

5. When creating/updating plans:
   - Use templates by reference instead of copying
   - Include only changed sections in updates
   - Reference files by line number ranges

### Implementation Plan Template

```md
# Implementation Plan: Configure roocode-generator Environment Bindings

## Overview

Analyze the roocode-generator project context, including configuration and documentation (overview, developer guide, status, architecture). This Node.js/TypeScript CLI tool uses LangChain and LLMs to generate RooCode configurations. Extract or generate appropriate values for the required template bindings based on the project's architecture, workflow, and development practices.

## Memory Bank References

The following memory-bank files were consulted:

- `ProjectOverview.md`: Project Configuration,ProjectOverview.md,DeveloperGuide.md,DevelopmentStatus.md,TechnicalArchitecture.md,MCP Servers Configuration
- `TechnicalArchitecture.md`: Modular CLI Application,Template-based generation,Separation of Concerns (CLI, Config, Logic),LLM Integration via Abstraction Layer (LangChain),Command Pattern (CLI),Template Method Pattern (Generation),Facade Pattern (LangChain)
- `DeveloperGuide.md`: Trunk-Based Development,Conventional Commits,Semantic Release,ESLint (Code Linting),Prettier (Code Formatting),TypeScript (Static Typing)

## Task Status

| #   | Subtask | Status | Updated |
| --- | ------- | ------ | ------- |
| 1   | roocode-generator  | Status | Date    |

## Subtasks

### 1. roocode-generator

- **Status**: In Progress
- **Objective**: Generate RooCode workflow configuration files using a Node.js/TypeScript CLI tool powered by LLMs via LangChain.
- **Files**: `path/to/file` - Initial population of template bindings based on project analysis.
- **Steps**: 1) Holistically analyze the provided project configuration, documentation (Overview, Developer Guide, Status, Architecture), and MCP server context. 2) Map extracted and inferred information to the required template bindings, ensuring contextual accuracy and consistency.
- **Criteria**: Review the generated JSON object to confirm that all binding values accurately reflect the project's state, architecture, workflow, and documented information.
- **Memory Bank References**: Conventional Commits,Semantic Release,Modular CLI,TypeScript,Trunk-Based Development,LangChain Facade
- **Notes**: 

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] All subtasks have clear objectives
- [ ] File paths are specific and accurate
- [ ] Memory bank references included

```

### Mode Transition Protocol

When delegating to Code Mode:

1. Complete implementation plan with template
2. Verify all memory bank references
3. Use `switch_mode` with clear reason
4. Specify key memory bank files to reference

### Plan Updates

- Update when code-plan discrepancies found
- Mark subtasks status changes
- Include memory bank reference updates
- Communicate to other modes
