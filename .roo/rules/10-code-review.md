## Code Review Checklist

### 1. Purpose & Correctness
- [ ] Does the code achieve its stated goal?
- [ ] Does it address the requirements/issue completely?
- [ ] Is the logic sound and free of obvious flaws?
- [ ] Are edge cases considered and handled appropriately?

### 2. TypeScript & JavaScript Best Practices
- [ ] Use `const` by default; use `let` only when reassignment is necessary.
- [ ] Prefer `async/await` over raw Promises or callbacks for asynchronous operations.
- [ ] Use strict type checking (`strict: true` in `tsconfig.json` is enforced).
- [ ] Avoid `any` type where possible; define specific types or interfaces (`src/core/analysis/types.ts`, `src/core/config/interfaces.ts`, etc.).
- [ ] Use ES modules (`import`/`export`) consistently.
- [ ] Leverage modern JS features appropriately (e.g., optional chaining `?.`, nullish coalescing `??`).

### 3. Framework & Library Usage
- **Langchain:**
    - [ ] Verify correct and efficient use of LLM providers, agents, and chains.
    - [ ] Ensure prompts (`src/generators/rules/rules-prompt-builder.ts`, `src/memory-bank/prompt-builder.ts`) are clear, concise, and effective.
    - [ ] Check handling of LLM responses (`src/core/analysis/response-parser.ts`).
- **Commander.js / Inquirer.js:**
    - [ ] Validate clear and intuitive CLI command definitions (`bin/roocode-generator.ts`, `src/commands/`).
    - [ ] Ensure user prompts (`Inquirer.js`) are necessary and well-phrased.
- **reflect-metadata & DI:**
    - [ ] Verify correct usage of `@injectable()` and `@inject()` decorators (`src/core/di/decorators.ts`).
    - [ ] Ensure dependencies are registered correctly in `src/core/di/registrations.ts`.
    - [ ] Confirm dependencies are injected via constructor, not resolved manually where possible.
    - [ ] Check for adherence to defined interfaces (`src/**/interfaces.ts`).

### 4. Project Structure & Architecture
- [ ] Does the new code belong in its designated module (`core`, `generators`, `memory-bank`, etc.)?
- [ ] Are components correctly placed within their subdirectories (e.g., `analysis`, `config`, `llm`)?
- [ ] Are interfaces defined in the appropriate `interfaces.ts` files?
- [ ] Is the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) generally followed for classes/modules?
- [ ] Avoid circular dependencies between modules.

### 5. Error Handling & `Result` Pattern
- [ ] Use the custom `Result<T, E>` type (`src/core/result/result.ts`) for operations that can fail.
- [ ] Ensure functions returning `Result` are handled correctly (check for `isSuccess()` / `isFailure()`).
- [ ] Avoid throwing raw errors where a `Failure` result is more appropriate.
- [ ] Use specific error types (`src/core/errors/`, `src/core/file-operations/errors.ts`, etc.) within `Failure` results when applicable.
```typescript
// Good: Handling Result
const fileReadResult = await fileOps.readFile("path/to/file");
if (fileReadResult.isFailure()) {
  logger.error("Failed to read file", fileReadResult.error);
  return fileReadResult; // Propagate error Result
}
const content = fileReadResult.value;
```

### 6. Readability & Maintainability
- [ ] Are variable, function, and class names clear, descriptive, and consistent?
- [ ] Is the code well-formatted (Prettier should handle this)?
- [ ] Is complex logic broken down into smaller, understandable functions/methods?
- [ ] Are comments used effectively to explain *why*, not *what*, for complex or non-obvious code? Avoid redundant comments.
- [ ] Remove dead or commented-out code.
- [ ] Keep functions/methods reasonably short.

### 7. Testing
- [ ] Are there new or updated tests (`*.test.ts`) covering the changes?
- [ ] Do tests cover main logic paths and important edge cases?
- [ ] Do all tests pass (`npm test`)?

### 8. Configuration & Environment
- [ ] Are configuration values accessed correctly via services (`LlmConfigService`, `ProjectConfigService`)?
- [ ] Avoid hardcoding configuration values; use `llm.config.json`, `roocode-config.json`, or environment variables (`dotenv`).

### 9. Dependencies
- [ ] Are new dependencies necessary and justified?
- [ ] Are dependencies correctly listed in `package.json` (`dependencies` vs `devDependencies`)?
