## MCP SERVERS

# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Configuration

MCP enables AI models to interact with external tools and services through a unified interface, following a client-server architecture where AI assistants can discover and use tools provided by MCP servers.

## Transport Mechanisms
- STDIO Transport: Used for local servers, provides lower latency and better security
- SSE Transport: Used for remote servers, supports multiple client connections

## Configured Servers
No MCP servers are currently configured. To add servers, create a configuration in either:
- .roo/mcp.json (project-specific)
- .vscode/mcp.json (workspace-specific)
- mcp.json (root level)

## Best Practices
- Use STDIO transport for local/secure operations
- Use SSE transport for remote/scalable operations
- Store secrets in environment variables
- Version control project-specific configurations
- Regular testing and monitoring of server health
- Use appropriate timeout settings for network operations

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Windows
Use cmd and /c for command execution:
Example: { command: 'cmd', args: ["/c", "npx", "-y", "server"] }

### Unix (macOS/Linux)
Direct executable usage:
Example: { command: 'npx', args: ["-y", "server"] }

## Runtime Version Management
- mise configuration supported
- asdf configuration supported
- Ensures consistent runtime environments

## Quick Troubleshooting
- Server not responding → Check process and network
- Permission errors → Verify API keys and credentials
- Tool unavailable → Verify server implementation
- Performance issues → Check network timeouts

- No `cd` for changing task context
- Consider active terminals before running commands
- Use search_files for finding patterns
- Organize new projects logically
- Prefer apply_diff over write_to_file for edits
- Provide complete file content when using write_to_file
- Make compatible, standards-compliant code changes
- Use ask_followup_question sparingly
- End with attempt_completion when task is done

## TOKEN OPTIMIZATION

### Memory Bank File Access

1. Implementation Patterns:

   ```xml
   <read_file>
   <path>[[DeveloperGuide]]</path>
   <start_line>[[TechnicalArchitecture#Design-Patterns]]</start_line>
   <end_line>[[TechnicalArchitecture#Design-Patterns]]</end_line>
   </read_file>
   ```

2. Testing Standards:

   ```xml
   <read_file>
   <path>[[DeveloperGuide#Quality-and-Testing]]</path>
   <start_line>[[DeveloperGuide#Quality-and-Testing]]</start_line>
   <end_line>[[DeveloperGuide#Quality-and-Testing]]</end_line>
   </read_file>
   ```

3. Pattern Search:

   ```xml
   <search_files>
   <path>src</path>
   <regex>function.*implement|class.*extend</regex>
   </search_files>
   ```

4. When checking code:

   - Focus on implementation sections
   - Read only relevant patterns
   - For code patterns: memory-bank/TechnicalArchitecture.md:50-60
   - For testing standards: memory-bank/DeveloperGuide.md:80-90
   - For status updates: memory-bank/DevelopmentStatus.md:5-15

5. When implementing code:
   - Search for similar patterns
   - Update only changed sections
   - Use regex for finding code blocks

### Completion Report Template

```md
# Completion Report: Generate RooCode Configuration

## Summary

Utilize the CLI with interactive prompts (inquirer) to gather user requirements. Optionally leverage LangChain to query LLMs (OpenAI, Google Genai, Anthropic) for analysis and suggestions based on project context. Populate predefined templates from the './templates' directory using the gathered information and generate the corresponding RooCode configuration file (e.g., memory bank, rule, system prompt).

## Memory Bank References

Standards followed:

- `[[DeveloperGuide]]`: TypeScript for core logic.,ESLint for code linting and quality checks.,Prettier for code formatting.,Conventional Commits standard for Git commit messages (enforced by commitlint/husky).,Trunk-Based Development workflow.,Automated releases via Semantic Release.
- `[[TechnicalArchitecture]]`: Modular CLI application architecture.,Feature-based modules ('generators/' directory).,Command Pattern for CLI structure.,Template Method Pattern for generation process.,Separation of Concerns (CLI interaction, core logic, LLM communication, templating).,Facade Pattern (LangChain abstracting LLM APIs).,Template-based file generation.
- `[[DeveloperGuide#Quality-and-Testing]]`: No automated tests are currently implemented. Testing relies on manual execution and validation. A placeholder 'test' script exists in package.json. Future plans include implementing unit and integration tests using Jest or Vitest.

## Implementation Details

- **Changes Made**: Specific changes depend on the exact task or feature being implemented. Changes typically involve modifications within the 'generators' directory for logic, potentially adding/updating files in 'templates', and updating CLI command handling in 'bin'. Commits follow Conventional Commits standard.
- **Components Modified**: CLI Interface (bin/, inquirer),Generator Modules (generators/),LangChain Integration (@langchain/*),Template Engine (templates/),Configuration Management (Filesystem interaction),Utility Modules (chalk)
- **Tests Added**: No automated test files exist.

## Verification Results

- [ ] All requirements implemented
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Standards followed

## Next Steps

- Refining LLM integrations via LangChain.,Enhancing interactive CLI experience (Inquirer).,Expanding template-based file generation capabilities.,Adding support for generating various configuration types (memory banks, rules, system prompts, Copilot configs).,Establishing core project structure and build processes.
- Lack of automated testing framework and test coverage, increasing risk of regressions.,Error handling may be basic, especially for edge cases or invalid input.,Performance characteristics with large projects or complex LLM interactions are untested.,Relies on external LLM APIs which require user-provided keys and are subject to provider availability/limits.
- Implement comprehensive automated test suite (unit, integration) with code coverage tracking (Jest/Vitest planned).,Enhance LLM analysis capabilities (e.g., deeper code understanding).,Support additional LLM providers or model customization.,Implement robust input validation and improve error handling.,Develop more sophisticated template options.,Expand user documentation and examples.,Address technical debt related to lack of tests.
