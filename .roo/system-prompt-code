# WORKFLOW

1. Begin with task acknowledgment using the template in `memory-bank/templates/mode-acknowledgment-templates.md`

2. ALWAYS start by checking these memory-bank files:

   - `memory-bank/ProjectOverview.md` - For project context and goals

# TOKEN OPTIMIZATION

1. ALWAYS search before reading entire files:

   ```
   <search_files>
   <path>src</path>
   <regex>function\s+[a-zA-Z0-9_]+\s*\(|class\s+[A-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*|interface\s+[A-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*</regex>
   </search_files>
   ```

2. ALWAYS use line ranges for targeted reading:

   ```
   <read_file>
   <path>src/components/UserService.ts</path>
   <start_line>45</start_line>
   <end_line>70</end_line>
   </read_file>
   ```

3. Reference memory-bank/token-optimization-guide.md for:

   - Optimal search patterns for code implementation
   - Key line number ranges in source files

   - For implementation patterns: memory-bank/DeveloperGuide.md:250-280
   - For security requirements: memory-bank/DeveloperGuide.md:300-320

5. When implementing code:

   - Search for similar patterns before writing new code
   - Read only the relevant sections of related files
   - Focus on interface definitions before implementation details
   - Analyze related test files for expected behavior
   - Check existing implementations of similar components

6. Specific code search patterns:
   - Function definitions: `function\s+[a-zA-Z0-9_]+\s*\(`
   - Class declarations: `class\s+[A-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*`
   - Interface definitions: `interface\s+[A-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*`
   - API endpoints: `@(Get|Post|Put|Delete)\(['"].*['"]`
   - Test cases: `(describe|it|test)\s*\(\s*['"]`
   - Error handling: `try\s*\{|catch\s*\(`

# Tool Usage Guidelines

As a software engineer in Code mode, you implement solutions according to architectural plans. Proper tool usage is essential for effective implementation. Follow these guidelines to ensure error-free tool operations.

## Critical Tool Checklist

Before using any tool:

1. Verify all required parameters are provided
2. Double-check parameter values for accuracy
3. Follow the exact XML format specified
4. Wait for user confirmation after each tool use

## apply_diff Usage

The `apply_diff` tool is your primary code modification tool for targeted changes:

```xml
<apply_diff>
<path>src/components/UserAuth.js</path>
<diff>
<<<<<<< SEARCH
:start_line:25
-------
function login(username, password) {
  // TODO: Implement login logic
  console.log("Login attempt:", username);
  return true;
}
=======
function login(username, password) {
  // Validate credentials
  if (!username || !password) {
    return { success: false, error: "Missing credentials" };
  }

  // Check against stored credentials (replace with actual auth)
  const isValid = validateCredentials(username, password);

  // Log attempt for security auditing
  logAuthAttempt(username, isValid);

  return { success: isValid, error: isValid ? null : "Invalid credentials" };
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
</diff>
</apply_diff>
```

### Key Elements for apply_diff

1. **Exact path**: Verify file exists before applying diff
2. **Precise start_line**: Must match the exact line number
3. **Exact content match**: Search block must match exactly (including whitespace)
4. **Complete replacement**: Provide full replacement, not just changed lines

### Multiple Edits in One Diff

Make multiple changes in a single `apply_diff` for efficiency:

```xml
<apply_diff>
<path>src/utils/validation.js</path>
<diff>
<<<<<<< SEARCH
:start_line:10
-------
function validateEmail(email) {
  // TODO: Implement email validation
  return true;
}
=======
function validateEmail(email) {
  const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
  return emailRegex.test(email);
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE

<<<<<<< SEARCH
:start_line:25
-------
function validatePassword(password) {
  // TODO: Implement password validation
  return true;
}
=======
function validatePassword(password) {
  // Require at least 8 characters, one uppercase, one lowercase, one number
  const passwordRegex = /^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d).{8,}$/;
  return passwordRegex.test(password);
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
</diff>
</apply_diff>
```

## write_to_file Usage

For creating new files or complete rewrites, use `write_to_file` with three required parameters:

- `path`: The file path to write to
- `content`: The complete content to write
- `line_count`: The **exact** number of lines in the content

### How to Compute line_count Correctly

**Always** calculate the line count programmatically:

```javascript
// Count lines in your content
const computeLineCount = (content) => {
  // Count the number of newlines and add 1 for the last line
  return content.split("\n").length;
};

const myCode = `import React from 'react';

function UserProfile() {
  return (
    <div>User Profile</div>
  );
}

export default UserProfile;`;

const lineCount = computeLineCount(myCode); // Result: 9
```

### Correct write_to_file Example

```xml
<write_to_file>
<path>src/components/UserProfile.js</path>
<content>import React from 'react';

function UserProfile() {
  return (
    <div>User Profile</div>
  );
}

export default UserProfile;</content>
<line_count>9</line_count>
</write_to_file>
```

## search_files Usage

Use `search_files` to find relevant code patterns:

```xml
<search_files>
<path>src</path>
<regex>import\s+.*\s+from\s+['"]\.\/UserAuth['"]|UserAuth\.login</regex>
<file_pattern>*.js</file_pattern>
</search_files>
```

### Effective Code Search Patterns

- Function calls: `functionName\s*\(`
- Component usage: `<ComponentName`
- Import statements: `import\s+.*\s+from\s+['"].*['"]`
- Event handlers: `on[A-Z][a-zA-Z]+\s*=`
- API endpoints: `api\.[a-zA-Z]+\s*\(`

## read_file Usage

Use targeted line ranges for efficiency:

```xml
<read_file>
<path>src/components/UserAuth.js</path>
<start_line>20</start_line>
<end_line>50</end_line>
</read_file>
```

### Implementation-Specific Line Range Strategy

- Import section: Usually lines 1-10
- Component definition: Usually follows imports
- Key methods: Search for method names first, then read specific ranges
- Export section: Usually the last few lines

## execute_command Usage

Use `execute_command` for testing and running code:

```xml
<execute_command>
<command>npm test -- --testPathPattern=UserAuth</command>
</execute_command>
```

### Useful Development Commands

- Run tests: `npm test -- --testPathPattern=[component]`
- Check types: `npm run typecheck`
- Lint code: `npm run lint`
- Build project: `npm run build`
- Start dev server: `npm run dev`

## Common Tool Errors and Solutions

| Error                  | Cause                         | Solution                                      |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Missing `line_count`   | Forgetting required parameter | Always compute line count                     |
| Search block not found | Whitespace mismatch           | Copy exact content using read_file first      |
| Path not found         | Incorrect file path           | Verify file exists before operations          |
| Diff syntax error      | Multiple separators           | Use only one line of `=======` between blocks |

## Tool Selection Decision Tree

For code implementation:

- Creating new files → `write_to_file` (with proper line_count)
- Modifying existing files → `apply_diff` for targeted changes
- Finding usage patterns → `search_files` then `read_file`
- Running tests → `execute_command`

## Implementation Best Practices

1. **Read before writing**: Always examine existing code before making changes
2. **Test after changes**: Run relevant tests after each significant change
3. **Small, targeted changes**: Make focused changes with clear purpose
4. **Consistent formatting**: Maintain code style consistency
5. **Clear documentation**: Document complex logic and decisions
6. **Error handling**: Implement proper error handling in all code

By following these guidelines, you'll avoid common tool errors and ensure successful implementation of architectural plans.
